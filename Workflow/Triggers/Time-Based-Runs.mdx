## Overview

The **Time-Based Runs (Time Trigger)** node allows you to automatically start workflows at specific times or intervals without manual intervention.
It is ideal for scheduling recurring tasks such as data updates, report generation, system cleanups, or automated notifications.

This node ensures workflows are triggered consistently according to your defined schedule, making it a reliable automation starter for time-driven operations.

---

## Description

The **Time Trigger** node is used to run workflows on a schedule.
It can be configured to execute based on three modes:

1. **Interval** – Runs at regular time intervals (e.g., every 3 minutes).
2. **Natural Description** – Uses simple human-readable time expressions (e.g., “every Monday at 9am”).
3. **CRON Expression** – Uses an advanced CRON format for precise control (e.g., “0 9 \* \* 1-5” for weekdays at 9am).

You can define **only one scheduling mode** at a time — the other two must be left empty.
Once configured, the workflow will automatically start at the specified time.

## Input Parameters

| **Parameter**           | **Type** | **Description**                                                                                                                            | **Required** |
| ----------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------ |
| **interval**            | string   | _(Optional)_ Defines how frequently the workflow should run using a CRON step pattern. Example: `"*/5"` runs the workflow every 5 minutes. | ✖            |
| **natural_description** | string   | _(Optional)_ A human-readable scheduling format. Example: `"every 3 hours"` or `"every weekday at 9am"`.                                   | ✖            |
| **cron_description**    | string   | _(Optional)_ A full CRON expression for advanced scheduling. Example: `"0 9 * * 1-5"` to trigger at 9am Monday–Friday.                     | ✖            |

**Instructions:**

- You must provide **only one** of the above parameters per node.
- All parameters are simple strings (no nested objects or arrays).
- Unused scheduling parameters should be left blank (`null`).
- Access parameter values in workflows using:

  ```
  {{timeTrigger.input.interval}}
  {{timeTrigger.input.natural_description}}
  {{timeTrigger.input.cron_description}}
  ```

## Output Parameters

This node does **not** produce outputs.
It is purely a **trigger** — its role is to initiate workflow execution based on time conditions.

**Output Parameters:** N/A
**Instructions:** No outputs are exposed to downstream nodes.

---

## Output Type

**Output Type:** N/A
This node does not generate any data output; it only triggers workflow execution.

---

## Example Usage

### Example 1: Interval-Based Schedule

```json
{
  "interval": "*/10",
  "natural_description": null,
  "cron_description": null
}
```

**Expected Behavior:**
The workflow runs automatically every 10 minutes.

---

### Example 2: Natural Language Schedule

```json
{
  "interval": null,
  "natural_description": "every day at 6pm",
  "cron_description": null
}
```

**Expected Behavior:**
The workflow triggers once daily at 6:00 PM local time.

---

### Example 3: CRON Expression Schedule

```json
{
  "interval": null,
  "natural_description": null,
  "cron_description": "0 9 * * 1-5"
}
```

**Expected Behavior:**
The workflow runs automatically at **9:00 AM, Monday through Friday**.

## How to Use in a No-Code Workflow

1. **Add the Time Trigger Node**
   Drag and drop the **Time-Based Runs** node as the first node in your workflow.

2. **Select a Scheduling Mode**
   Choose one of the three available scheduling methods — _interval_, _natural language_, or _CRON expression_.

3. **Configure Schedule**

   - Use **interval** for quick recurring runs (e.g., every 5 minutes).
   - Use **natural_description** for simple human-readable schedules (e.g., “every day at 9am”).
   - Use **cron_description** for advanced timing needs.

4. **Leave Other Fields Empty**
   Make sure only one scheduling parameter is filled; the others must remain `null`.

5. **Connect Downstream Nodes**
   Link the time trigger to other nodes, such as **Data Fetch**, **AI Generation**, or **Email Notification**, to automate periodic actions.

6. **Activate the Workflow**
   Once configured, activate the workflow. It will automatically execute according to your defined schedule.

---

## Best Practices

- Use **interval** for simple repeat tasks (e.g., every few minutes or hours).
- Use **natural_description** for readability in business or team workflows.
- Use **cron_description** for complex or system-level automation.
- Ensure your workflow remains active; paused workflows will not run automatically.
- Avoid overlapping intervals (e.g., setting both “\*/1” and “every minute”).
- Always test schedules with short intervals before deploying long-running jobs.
- Use descriptive labels or comments to clarify what each scheduled trigger does.

## Example Workflow Integration

**Use Case:** Automatically refresh AI-generated content every day.

**Workflow Steps:**

1. **Trigger Node:** Time-Based Runs. (Runs daily at 9am).
2. **AI Node:** Text Generation (Generates the day’s content.)
3. **Utility Node:** Send Email (Sends the generated content to subscribers.)

## Common Errors

- **"Multiple schedule parameters set"**
  **Cause:** More than one scheduling mode (interval/natural/cron) was filled.
  **Solution:** Only one scheduling parameter should be set; leave others as `null`.

- **"Invalid CRON expression"**
  **Cause:** Incorrect CRON syntax (missing fields or invalid format).
  **Solution:** Verify CRON format using a CRON validator (e.g., crontab.guru).

- **"Empty schedule"**
  **Cause:** All scheduling fields were left empty.
  **Solution:** Provide at least one valid scheduling parameter.

- **"Workflow did not start"**
  **Cause:** The workflow is inactive or disabled.
  **Solution:** Ensure the workflow is active and properly connected.
