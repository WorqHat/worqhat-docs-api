## Overview

The **Email Trigger Node** automatically starts a workflow whenever an incoming email is received at a unique, system-generated email address.

This node is ideal for building workflows that respond to incoming messages such as support ticket systems, automated acknowledgment replies, spam filtering, attachment processing, or email-to-database automation.

Once configured, any email sent to the unique workflow address will immediately trigger the workflow and make all email details (like sender, subject, message, and attachments) available to downstream nodes.

---

## Description

When a workflow includes an **Email Trigger Node**, a **unique email address** is generated for it in the format:

```
workflow-[id]@inbox.worqhat.com
```

Any email sent to this address will start the workflow automatically.

The node captures all details of the received email — including sender (`from`), subject, message body (HTML or text), attachments, spam and virus scores, and delivery information. These values are then made available to other nodes in the workflow.

If your workflow does not yet have an email address, you can set the parameter `incomingEmail` to:

```
{{GENERATE_INCOMING_EMAIL}}
```

This tells the system to automatically create and assign a new incoming email address.

---

## Input Parameters

**Note:**

* Only `incomingEmail` needs to be configured manually; all other fields are automatically populated when an email is received.
* You can access any of these parameters in downstream nodes using the syntax:

  ```
  {{emailTrigger.input.<parameterName>}}
  ```


The **Email Trigger** node receives and exposes several parameters that represent the details of incoming emails.

* **incomingEmail** 
  The unique incoming email address assigned to this workflow.
  Use `"{{GENERATE_INCOMING_EMAIL}}"` if you want the system to automatically create one.

* **htmlMessage** 
  The full HTML version of the received email’s body content.

* **textMessage** 
  The plain text version of the email message.

* **subject** 
  The subject line of the received email.

* **from** 
  The sender’s email address.

* **to** 
  The recipient’s email address — usually the unique workflow email address.

* **cc / bcc** 
  Lists of carbon copy (CC) and blind carbon copy (BCC) recipients, if included.

* **inReplyTo** 
  The message ID of the email this one is replying to, if applicable.

* **references** 
  A reference chain showing related messages in an email thread.

* **attachmentFile** 
  The file ID of any attachment included in the email.

* **attachmentFileName** 
  The name of the attached file.

* **attachmentFileType** 
  The MIME type of the attached file (e.g., `"image/png"`, `"application/pdf"`).

* **attachmentFileSize**
  The size of the attachment, in bytes or a human-readable format.

* **spamScore** 
  A numerical score estimating the likelihood that the email is spam.

* **virusScore** 
  A numerical score estimating the likelihood that the email contains malicious content.

* **deliveryTime** 
  The exact delivery timestamp of the email in ISO format.

* **deliveryId** 
  A unique identifier assigned to the email delivery.

* **deliveryStatus** 
  Indicates the delivery result, such as “delivered” or “failed.”

---

**Instructions:**

* You **must** configure `incomingEmail` once per workflow.
* All other fields are automatically populated when an email is received.
* Access values within the workflow using:

  ```
  {{emailTrigger.input.subject}}
  {{emailTrigger.input.from}}
  {{emailTrigger.input.textMessage}}
  {{emailTrigger.input.attachmentFile}}
  ```

## Output Parameters

This node has **no direct outputs**, as all received email data is available through input parameters.

**Output Parameters:** N/A

**Instructions:**
Downstream nodes can directly use these input values to perform tasks such as AI summarization, classification, or attachment processing.

---

## Output Type

**Output Type:** N/A
This node does not generate any new data output; it only exposes received email content to the workflow.

---

## Example Usage

### Example 1: Workflow with Generated Email Address

```json
{
  "incomingEmail": "{{GENERATE_INCOMING_EMAIL}}"
}
```

**Expected Behavior:**
A unique email address (e.g., `workflow-123@inbox.worqhat.com`) is generated automatically.
Any future email sent to this address will trigger the workflow and populate all message fields.

---

### Example 2: Workflow Using an Existing Email Address

```json
{
  "incomingEmail": "workflow-123@inbox.worqhat.com"
}
```

**Expected Behavior:**
The workflow triggers when this address receives an email.
All details — including sender, subject, and attachments — are captured and can be accessed using variables like:

```
{{emailTrigger.input.subject}}
{{emailTrigger.input.from}}
{{emailTrigger.input.htmlMessage}}
```

---

## How to Use in a No-Code Workflow

1. **Add the Email Trigger Node**
   Drag and drop the **Email Trigger** node into your workflow as the first node.

2. **Generate or Set Incoming Email**

   * Set `incomingEmail` to `"{{GENERATE_INCOMING_EMAIL}}"` to let the system create a new unique address.
   * If an address already exists, paste it in directly.

3. **Save and Deploy the Workflow**
   After saving, note the generated email address. Any incoming email to this address will now trigger the workflow.

4. **Connect to Processing Nodes**
   Link the node to others like **Text Generation**, **Content Moderation**, or **File Storage** to automate email handling.

5. **Test the Workflow**
   Send a test email to the generated address and confirm that the workflow triggers automatically.

---

## Best Practices

* Always use the `{{GENERATE_INCOMING_EMAIL}}` placeholder for new workflows to ensure unique email creation.
* Avoid sharing the generated workflow email publicly to prevent spam.
* Use **Content Moderation** or **Spam Filtering** nodes for safer automation.
* Utilize both `htmlMessage` and `textMessage` for flexible content extraction.
* For attachments, use downstream nodes like **File Storage** or **Text Extraction** to process files.
* Keep an eye on the `spamScore` and `virusScore` fields for automated security actions.

## Example Workflow Integration

**Use Case:** Automatically summarize incoming support emails.

**Workflow Steps:**

1. **Email Trigger Node** – Captures new email messages.
2. **Text Generation Node** – Summarizes the email body.
3. **Slack Message Node** – Sends the summary to a support channel.

**Connection Example:**

```
{{emailTrigger.input.textMessage}} → {{textGeneration.input.prompt}}
{{textGeneration.output.content}} → {{slackMessage.input.message}}
```

## Common Errors

* **"Missing incomingEmail"**
  **Cause:** `incomingEmail` parameter not set.
  **Solution:** Add `"{{GENERATE_INCOMING_EMAIL}}"` to generate a new address or use an existing one.

* **"Email address already in use"**
  **Cause:** The same email address is assigned to multiple workflows.
  **Solution:** Each workflow must have a unique email trigger address.

* **"Empty email body"**
  **Cause:** The received email had no body content.
  **Solution:** Ensure you handle both `textMessage` and `htmlMessage` for flexibility.

* **"Attachment not found"**
  **Cause:** Email contained an attachment but it failed to upload or reference correctly.
  **Solution:** Verify attachment settings and downstream node compatibility.
