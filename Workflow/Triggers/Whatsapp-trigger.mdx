# WhatsApp Trigger

**Category:** Trigger
**Type:** Event-Based

---

## Overview

The **WhatsApp Trigger** node automatically starts your workflow whenever a new WhatsApp message is received.
It’s perfect for automating responses, logging incoming chats, or kicking off custom actions when someone messages you on WhatsApp.

---

## Description

This node listens for incoming WhatsApp messages through your connected WhatsApp account.
Whenever someone sends a text or media message, it instantly activates the workflow and passes the message details — like sender name, message body, and attachments — to the next steps in your automation.

You can use it to:

* Send auto-replies to specific keywords.
* Store received messages in a database.
* Forward media or text to another channel.
* Trigger smart responses using AI nodes.

All message data is automatically captured by the node, so you don’t need to configure anything manually.

---

## Input Parameters

The WhatsApp Trigger includes five automatically-filled fields whenever a new message is received:

* **messageId** → The unique ID of the incoming WhatsApp message.
* **from** → The WhatsApp number or name of the sender.
* **to** → The WhatsApp number or name of the receiver (your connected account).
* **body** → The text content of the message. Empty if the message contains only media.
* **file** → The file reference or ID if an image, PDF, video, or other attachment is sent.

These values are automatically populated by WhatsApp’s webhook system — you don’t have to set them yourself.
You can access them anywhere in the workflow using variables like:

```
{{nodeId.input.messageId}}
{{nodeId.input.from}}
{{nodeId.input.to}}
{{nodeId.input.body}}
{{nodeId.input.file}}
```

---

## Output Parameters

This node doesn’t create new outputs.
Its purpose is to **make WhatsApp message data available** for use in other connected nodes.

---

## Output Type

There’s no output type — this node simply exposes message information to the rest of your workflow.

---

## Example Usage

### Example 1 — Basic Text Message

When someone sends:

```json
{
  "messageId": "1",
  "from": "Akshay",
  "to": "John",
  "body": "meet at evening"
}
```

Your workflow might respond or store the message like this:

```json
{
  "message": "meet at evening"
}
```

The workflow starts automatically when the message arrives, using the text `"meet at evening"` as input for the next node.

---

### Example 2 — Message with Attachment

If a message includes media:

```json
{
  "messageId": "4523",
  "from": "+919876543210",
  "to": "+911234567890",
  "body": "Please find the attached report.",
  "file": "report_2025.pdf"
}
```

The workflow can use the `file` field to download, store, or forward the attachment to another system.

## How to Use in a No-Code Workflow

1. **Add the WhatsApp Trigger Node**
   Drag and drop the node as the first step in your workflow. It acts as the workflow’s starting point.

2. **Connect It to Action Nodes**
   Link it to a node that performs an action — for example, a **Send Message**, **Text Generation**, or **Return State** node.

3. **Use Message Data**
   You can use dynamic variables like `{{nodeId.input.body}}` to read the user’s message and respond accordingly.

4. **Save and Activate**
   Once connected, save and activate the workflow.
   Now, every time a WhatsApp message is received, the workflow will start automatically.

---

## Best Practices

* Use `{{nodeId.input.body}}` to check or process the user’s text.
* If the `file` field has a value, handle it before performing text-only actions.
* Store important messages or attachments in a database for record-keeping.
* Combine this node with a **Text Generation** node to create auto-replies.
* Add a **Condition** node if you want the workflow to react differently depending on message content.

---



## Common Errors and Fixes

* **Workflow doesn’t trigger:**
  Check if your WhatsApp webhook or integration is properly connected.

* **File field is empty:**
  The message didn’t include media. Skip file processing for text-only messages.

* **Message body missing:**
  This happens if the message only contained an attachment — use the `file` value instead.

* **No response or action:**
  Make sure you’ve connected another node (like “Return State” or “Send Message”) after the trigger.
