## Overview

The **REST API Trigger** node starts a workflow automatically when an external service or application sends an HTTP request to a specific REST API endpoint.
It acts as the entry point for workflows that need to be triggered by external systems, such as websites, mobile apps, or third-party APIs.

---

## Description

This node is used to trigger workflows through REST API calls.
Whenever an external service makes a request to the provided endpoint, the workflow is activated, and the incoming data is passed to downstream nodes.

It supports **GET**, **POST**, and **PUT** requests, and can accept data in multiple formats — such as **JSON**, **form-data**, or **query parameters**.
This makes it ideal for integrating workflows with custom apps, webhooks, or backend systems.

---

## Input Parameters

The **REST API Trigger** node accepts dynamic flat key-value pairs sent by an external request.
You can define any keys according to the data you expect from the incoming call.

- **exampleKey** _(string, optional)_
  A placeholder for a key in the incoming request.
  Example:

  ```
  "userId": "12345"
  ```

- **exampleKey2** _(string, optional)_
  Another example input key.
  Example:

  ```
  "email": "example@domain.com"
  ```

- **exampleKey3** _(string, optional)_
  Any additional input data you may send through the API.
  Example:

  ```
  "source": "mobile-app"
  ```

**Instructions:**

- The node accepts only **flat key-value pairs** (no nested objects).
- Data can be sent via:

  - JSON body (`application/json`)
  - Form data (`x-www-form-urlencoded`)
  - Query parameters (e.g., `?userId=123&source=web`)

- Arrays must be JSON-encoded (e.g., `["a", "b", "c"]`).
- Files cannot be attached to this trigger.
- All keys are optional and schema-free; you can define your own structure as needed.
- Default values for undefined keys are `null`.

Access input data within the workflow using:

```
{{nodeId.input.<key>}}
```

Example:

```
{{restApiTrigger.input.userId}}
```

## Output Parameters

This node does not produce separate output variables.
Instead, it directly exposes the incoming request data for use by downstream nodes.

**Output Parameters:**
N/A

**Instructions:**
You can access incoming request values in other nodes using:

```
{{restApiTrigger.input.userId}}
{{restApiTrigger.input.email}}
{{restApiTrigger.input.source}}
```

---

## Output Type

**Output Type:** N/A
The node does not generate an independent output type — it only exposes input data from an external API request.

---

## Example Usage

### Example 1: Trigger Workflow with User Data

**Incoming API Request:**

```http
POST /api/workflows/trigger
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "userId": "001",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "source": "mobile"
}
```

**Accessible in Workflow:**

```
{{restApiTrigger.input.userId}}      → "001"
{{restApiTrigger.input.email}}       → "john@example.com"
{{restApiTrigger.input.source}}      → "mobile"
```

---

### Example 2: Trigger Workflow via URL Parameters

**Incoming Request:**

```
GET /api/workflows/trigger?productId=789&type=purchase
```

**Accessible in Workflow:**

```
{{restApiTrigger.input.productId}}   → "789"
{{restApiTrigger.input.type}}        → "purchase"
```

## How to Use in a No-Code Workflow

1. **Add the REST API Trigger Node**
   Place the node at the start of your workflow. It acts as the entry point for data received via HTTP requests.

2. **Copy the Workflow Endpoint**
   Each workflow generates a unique REST API endpoint (e.g., `https://yourdomain.com/api/workflows/trigger`).
   External systems will send data to this endpoint.

3. **Configure External Application**
   From any app, website, or backend service, send a request (POST, GET, or PUT) to the endpoint with your desired key-value data.

4. **Define Expected Fields**
   Downstream nodes can reference incoming keys using the `{{nodeId.input.<key>}}` format.
   Example:

   ```
   {{restApiTrigger.input.userId}}
   ```

5. **Test the Connection**
   Use a tool like Postman or cURL to send a test request to the workflow endpoint and confirm it triggers correctly.

6. **Connect to Other Nodes**
   Link this trigger to other nodes (e.g., AI, Database, Email) to process, analyze, or respond to incoming data automatically.

---

## Best Practices

- Use consistent key names (e.g., `userId`, `email`, `action`) across all requests.
- Validate your incoming request payloads before processing.
- If you expect large or complex data, send it as a JSON-encoded string.
- Avoid sending files directly; instead, send file URLs or file IDs.
- Use HTTPS for secure communication.
- Test your API endpoint thoroughly with Postman or similar tools before deployment.

## Example Workflow Integration

**Use Case:** Automatically process user signup data sent from an app.

1. **Trigger Node** - REST API Trigger(node receives signup details such as name and email.)
2. **AI Node** - Text Generation (drafts a welcome message.)
3. **Utility Node** - Send Email (sends the message to the user.)

## Common Errors

- **"Invalid JSON format"**
  **Cause:** The incoming request body is not properly formatted.
  **Solution:** Ensure valid JSON syntax or use form-data encoding.

- **"Missing endpoint or unauthorized access"**
  **Cause:** Request sent to the wrong endpoint or missing authorization headers.
  **Solution:** Verify the workflow’s API URL and authentication setup.

- **"Unsupported input type"**
  **Cause:** Files or unsupported data structures were sent.
  **Solution:** Only send text, numbers, booleans, or JSON-encoded strings.

- **"No data received"**
  **Cause:** Request was sent with an empty payload.
  **Solution:** Add at least one key-value pair in the request body or query string.
