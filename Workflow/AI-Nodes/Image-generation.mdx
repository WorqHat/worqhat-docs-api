## Overview

The **Image Generation Node** allows you to create AI-generated images from text descriptions. By simply providing a detailed prompt, you can produce realistic, artistic, or conceptual visuals automatically — no design skills required.

This node is perfect for generating images for product mockups, concept art, blog illustrations, or any visual automation use case within your no-code workflow. It also supports optional style references through attachments, enabling custom and consistent visual styles.

---

## Description

Use the **Image Generation Node** to transform a written prompt into one or more AI-generated images.
You can input plain text describing what you want (e.g., “a futuristic city at night, cyberpunk style”) and optionally attach reference images to guide the AI’s artistic direction.

The node outputs an image file or URL that can be used in downstream nodes for storage, display, or further processing.

---

## Input Parameters

The **Image Generation** node accepts simple key-value inputs that define how the AI should create an image.

* **prompt** 
  A detailed text description of the image you want to generate.
  Be specific — describe the subject, style, colors, lighting, and mood.
  Example:

  ```
  A cozy reading room with warm lighting and wooden furniture
  ```

* **attachments** 
  Comma-separated list of file IDs or variable references used as visual style references.
  You can provide multiple files using syntax like:

  ```
  file1.jpg,file2.jpg
  ```

  or dynamically from other nodes using:

  ```
  {{nodeId.output.image1}},{{nodeId.output.image2}}
  ```

  These attachments help the AI maintain a consistent look or replicate certain visual elements.


**Instructions:**
Provide all inputs as flat key-value pairs.
Dynamic references can be used to link outputs from previous nodes using `{{nodeId.output.<key>}}`.

**Instructions:**
Provide input values as flat key-value pairs. Access variables dynamically using:

```
{{nodeId.input.<key>}} or {{nodeId.output.<key>}}
```

Here’s your **Output Parameters** section rewritten in clear bullet-point format — keeping it consistent with your documentation style and easy for beginners to follow:

---

## Output Parameters

After execution, the **Image Generation** node provides information about the generated image and processing details.

* **processingCount** 
  Indicates the total number of images generated during the process.

* **processingTime** 
  The time taken to generate the image, returned in ISO timestamp format.

* **processingId** 
  A unique identifier assigned to this image generation task.
  Useful for tracking or referencing the specific generation process.

* **image** 
  The file reference or URL of the generated image.
  You can use this link to preview, download, or connect the image to another node.

**Instructions:**
Access output values in your workflow using the following variable syntax:

```
{{nodeId.output.image}}            → Generated image URL
{{nodeId.output.processingTime}}   → Total generation time
{{nodeId.output.processingId}}     → Unique process reference
```

## Output Type

**Type:** `image`
This node always produces image content as output. Do not modify this value — it ensures proper handling of image files in your workflow.

## Example Usage

### Example 1 — Image Generation

**Input:**

```json
{
  "prompt": "{
  "input": {
    "input_text": "A young woman sitting at a desk studying with books and a laptop, focused and surrounded by soft natural light from a nearby window, realistic style, calm and productive atmosphere."
  }
}",
  "attachments": "image.png"
}
```

**Output:**

```json
{
  "processingCount": 1,
  "processingTime": "2025-10-28T10:21:45.991Z",
  "processingId": "img-23841gh",
  "image": "https://example.com/images/generated_image.png"
}
```

## How to Use in a No-Code Workflow

1. **Add the Node:** Drag and drop the **Image Generation Node** into your workflow.
2. **Connect Input:** Link a text-based node (like *Text Generation* or *Triggers*) to provide the prompt.
3. **Set Prompt:** Describe what you want the image to depict, using detailed and visual language.
4. **Add Attachments (Optional):** Include one or more reference files or variables to influence the style.
5. **Run Workflow:** The node will generate an image and output the image file URL.
6. **Use Output:** Pass the generated image to downstream nodes — such as *File Upload*, *Email Attachment*, or *Slack Message*.

---

## Best Practices

* Use **clear and descriptive prompts** — mention subject, mood, lighting, and style.
* Keep prompts **under 500 characters** for faster results.
* Use **reference attachments** when you want consistent visuals (e.g., same style across multiple images).
* Combine this node with **Text Generation** to automatically create AI art from AI-written descriptions.
* Test multiple prompts for the same idea to discover the best output style.

## Example Workflow Integration

**Scenario:**
A workflow that automatically generates blog illustrations based on written content.

1. **AI Node:** (Creates an article or blog summary)
2. **Image Generation Node:** Generates a matching image based on the summary text.
3. **File Upload Node:** Uploads the generated image to your CMS or database.

Here’s your **Common Errors** section rewritten in bullet-point format — clear, structured, and easy for beginners to understand while matching your documentation style:

---

## Common Errors

Below are common issues that may occur while using the **Image Generation** node, along with their causes and suggested solutions.

* **"Missing prompt"**
  **Cause:** The `prompt` field was left empty or not provided.
  **Solution:** Enter a valid text prompt that clearly describes the image you want the AI to generate.

* **"Invalid attachment reference"**
  **Cause:** An incorrect file ID or variable reference was used in the `attachments` field.
  **Solution:** Verify that the file IDs or variable references are valid and formatted correctly.

* **"Image generation failed"**
  **Cause:** The AI service encountered a timeout or could not process the given prompt.
  **Solution:** Retry after a short delay or simplify the image description to make it easier to interpret.

* **"Empty output"**
  **Cause:** The workflow is misconfigured or the node is not connected properly.
  **Solution:** Ensure the **Image Generation** node is linked to valid inputs and other connected nodes in the workflow.
