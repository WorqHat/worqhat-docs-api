**Type:** Update Node

## Overview

The **Update Data Node** allows you to modify existing records in a database table.
It’s ideal for workflows where data needs to be updated automatically — for example, changing a user’s details, updating a timestamp, or modifying status information after another node’s execution.

This node works within your selected environment (like **production**) and uses **query fields** to locate the target record, then **data parameters** to apply the updates.

---

## Description

This node is used to update existing data in a connected database.
You can define which record(s) should be updated by setting query fields (such as `id`, `name`, or `email`) and then specify what values to update using data parameters.

For example, if you want to change a user’s name and email based on their ID, you can use this node to perform that action automatically — no SQL required.

---

## Input Parameters

The following inputs are accepted by this node:

- **id** – The unique identifier of the record you want to update. It’s used as both a query and data input.
- **name** – The updated name value that should replace the old one.
- **email** – The updated email address to store in the database.
- **created_at** – A timestamp (in ISO format) showing when the record was created or last modified.

All inputs are text-based except `created_at`, which should be a valid ISO date string (e.g., `2025-12-01T12:00:00.000Z`).

---

## Output Parameters

After execution, the node returns a structured output containing:

- **tableName** – The full name of the database table that was updated (for example, `production:test3`).
- **queryId** – A unique identifier assigned to the query run.
- **updatedCount** – The number of records successfully updated.
- **message** – A summary message describing the result of the operation.
- **status** – Indicates whether the update was successful or failed.

---

## Output Type

The node produces a JSON object as output, summarizing the operation’s success and update results.
This output can be used by subsequent nodes in your workflow for conditional actions, logging, or user notifications.

---

## Example Usage

**Example Input:**

```json
{
  "input": {
    "id": "10",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "jd@gmail.com",
    "created_at": "2025-12-01T12:00:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

**Example Output:**

```json
{
  "output": {
    "tableName": "production:test3",
    "queryId": "1d6330c7-e3c8-4712-a12f-4594242321d1",
    "updatedCount": 1,
    "message": "Successfully updated 1 record(s)",
    "status": "success"
  }
}
```

## How to Use in a No-Code Workflow

1. Add the **Update Data Node** from the **Database** category in your workflow.
2. Under **Select Update Type**, choose **“Update Data.”**
3. In **Table Name**, select the database table you want to modify (e.g., `test3 (production)`).
4. Add **Query Fields** — these define which records to find. For example:

   - `id = Input: id`
   - `email = Input: email`

5. Add **Data Parameters** — these specify what will be updated. For example:

   - `name = Input: name`
   - `created_at = Input: created_at`

6. Connect the node to any input node (such as a form, trigger, or data fetch node) that supplies the required fields.
7. Save your configuration and run the workflow.
8. Review the output message to confirm how many records were updated and whether the operation was successful.

---

## Best Practices

- Always use a **unique identifier** like `id` in your query fields to ensure only the correct record is updated.
- Make sure all input values (especially timestamps and emails) are correctly formatted before execution.
- Double-check that you’re updating the correct **environment** (e.g., production vs staging).
- If testing changes, work in a sandbox or non-production table to avoid overwriting live data.
- Use the output `message` and `status` for error checking or logging.

---

## Example Workflow Integration

Here’s an example of how the **Update Data Node** can be used in a typical workflow:

```
Form Submission → Data Validation → Update Data Node → Send Confirmation Email
```

- A user submits a form with updated information.
- The data is validated in a previous node.
- The Update Data Node modifies the existing database record.
- The workflow sends a confirmation email or message to the user.

## Common Errors and Solutions

**“Successfully updated 0 record(s)”**
No matching record was found using the provided query fields.
→ Recheck your query field values (e.g., correct `id` or `email`).

**“Table not found”**
The specified table name or environment is incorrect.
→ Verify that the table name exists and is selected properly.

**“Missing required field”**
A required input value was not provided.
→ Make sure all input parameters are connected to valid data sources.

**“Connection timeout”**
The node couldn’t reach the database.
→ Retry or check your network/database connection settings.
