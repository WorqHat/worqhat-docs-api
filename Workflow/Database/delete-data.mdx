**Type:** Delete Node

## Overview

The **Delete Data Node** allows you to remove specific records from your connected database automatically.
It’s used in workflows where you want to clean up data, delete user information, or remove outdated entries — all without writing any SQL code.

By defining simple query conditions, the node identifies matching records and deletes them permanently from the selected table.

---

## Description

This node deletes records from a database table based on matching criteria you define through **Query Fields**.
For example, if you specify the field `name` as your condition, the node will remove any records where the name matches the provided input.

It’s particularly useful when you need to handle data removal as part of automated workflows — such as account deletion requests, cleanup operations, or resetting test data.

---

## Input Parameters

The Delete Data Node can accept the following input values:

* **id** – The unique identifier of a record. This can be used if you want to target a specific record.
* **name** – The name of the record to delete. This is typically used as the main condition.
* **email** – The email address of the record (optional). It can be used for additional filtering.
* **created_at** – The timestamp when the record was created (optional, ISO format).

Only `name` is required in this setup, as it’s used in the query condition to find which record to remove.

---

## Output Parameters

Once executed, the node provides the following information as output:

* **tableName** – The name of the database table (or collection) where the deletion occurred, such as `production:test3`.
* **queryId** – A unique identifier automatically generated for the delete query.
* **deletedCount** – The number of records successfully deleted from the database.
* **message** – A brief summary describing the operation result.
* **status** – Shows whether the deletion was successful or not (for example, `success` or `error`).

---

## Output Type

The output is returned in **JSON format**, containing structured information about the delete action — including the target table, the number of records affected, and a success message.

This output can be used by other nodes for logging, confirmation messages, or audit tracking.

## Example Usage

**Example Input:**

```json
{
  "input": {
    "id": "10",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "jd@gmail.com",
    "created_at": "2025-12-01T12:00:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

**Example Output:**

```json
{
  "output": {
    "tableName": "production:test3",
    "queryId": "3b9ac2cb-71a4-493c-8db0-fa5fe6d72490",
    "deletedCount": 1,
    "message": "Successfully deleted 1 record(s)",
    "status": "success"
  }
}
```

## How to Use in a No-Code Workflow

1. Add the **Delete Data Node** to your workflow from the **Database** category.
2. Choose the correct **table or collection** where the data should be removed (for example, `test3 (production)`).
3. Under **Query Fields**, specify the condition that will identify which record(s) to delete.

   * Example: `name = Input: name`
4. Connect the node to a data source that provides the input (like a form or a trigger node).
5. Save your settings and **run the workflow**.
6. After execution, the node will display a message confirming whether any records were deleted.

---

## Best Practices

* Always use a **unique or specific query condition** (like `id` or an exact `name`) to prevent accidental deletion of multiple records.
* Test your workflow in a **staging environment** before using it in production.
* If possible, implement a **confirmation step** before deletion to avoid unintended data loss.
* Log the output message for tracking and debugging purposes.
* Never use overly broad filters (like deleting all records without conditions).

---

## Example Workflow Integration

Here’s an example of how the **Delete Data Node** can fit within a complete workflow:

```
User Request → Validation Node → Delete Data Node → Success Notification
```

1. A user triggers the workflow (for example, by submitting a “Delete Account” form).
2. The workflow validates the request details.
3. The **Delete Data Node** removes the matching record from the database.
4. The workflow sends a confirmation message or email to the user.

## Common Errors and Fixes

**“Successfully deleted 0 record(s)”**

* Cause: No record matched the query condition.
* Fix: Check that the input value (for example, the `name`) exists in the database.

**“Table not found”**

* Cause: The table or collection name is incorrect.
* Fix: Verify the table name and environment selection (such as production or staging).

**“Missing required field”**

* Cause: A required query parameter (for example, `name`) wasn’t provided.
* Fix: Ensure all required inputs are connected in the workflow.

**“Permission denied”**

* Cause: Insufficient permissions to delete from the table.
* Fix: Check your database credentials or admin access.
