# Fetch Data Node

**Category:** Database
**Type:** Data Retrieval Node

---

## Overview

The **Fetch Data** node allows you to retrieve stored records (also called “documents”) from your database collection.
You can fetch all records, a specific record, or simply count how many records exist — all without writing a single line of code.

This node is useful when your workflow needs to **read**, **analyze**, or **display** data that already exists in your database, such as user profiles, orders, or product lists.

---

## Description

The Fetch Data node connects your workflow to your chosen database collection and brings back the data you need.
It supports three main retrieval modes:

* **Fetch All Documents:** Retrieve every record inside a collection.
* **Fetch Specific Document:** Retrieve a single record by its ID or other criteria.
* **Count Documents:** Get only the total number of records.

This node is perfect for displaying stored information, generating reports, or processing user data inside no-code workflows.

---

## Input Parameters

**Node Description**

* Type: Text
* Description: A short internal note describing what this node does in your workflow.
* Required: No

**Select Action Type**

* Type: Dropdown (Select)
* Description: Defines what kind of fetch action you want to perform — fetch all, fetch one, or count.
* Required: Yes

**Collection Name**

* Type: Dropdown (Select)
* Description: The name of the collection (database) where your documents are stored. Example: `test3 (production)`.
* Required: Yes

---

## Output Parameters

When executed, this node provides a structured **JSON output** that other nodes can use.

**Output Fields:**

* **tableName:** The full collection name (e.g., `production:test3`).
* **queryId:** A unique ID generated for this fetch operation.
* **data:** The array of documents that were fetched from the collection.
* **message:** A success message describing the result.
* **status:** Indicates the result of the operation — usually `"success"` or `"error"`.

---

## Output Type

The node output is in **JSON format**, meaning the data is structured into fields and values.
This makes it easy for other workflow nodes to read, filter, or use the information directly.

## Example Usage

### Example 1 — Fetch All Documents

**Input:**

```json
{
  "Select Action Type": "Fetch All Documents",
  "Collection Name": "test3 (production)"
}
```

**Expected Output:**

```json
{
  "output": {
    "tableName": "production:test3",
    "queryId": "6e7b29a3-61a9-4e23-b1cc-9af3b4c8d190",
    "data": [
      {
        "id": "201",
        "name": "Alice Carter",
        "email": "alice.carter@startup.io",

      },
      {
        "id": "202",

        "email": "brian.thompson@agency.com",
        "bio": "Brian is a content strategist with a decade of experience in brand storytelling.",
        "active": "no",
        "created_at": "2024-12-10T14:30:00.000Z"
      },
      {
        "id": "203",
        "name": "Chloe Ramirez",
        "email": "chloe.ramirez@techlabs.ai",
        "bio": "Chloe is a data analyst who specializes in predictive modeling and insights reporting.",
        "active": "yes",
        "created_at": "2025-01-15T08:45:00.000Z"
      }
    ],
    "message": "Successfully fetched 3 documents",
    "status": "success"
  }
}
```

---

### Example 2 — Count Documents

**Input:**

```json
{
  "Select Action Type": "Count Documents",
  "Collection Name": "test3 (production)"
}
```

**Expected Output:**

```json
{
  "output": {
    "tableName": "production:test3",
    "count": 13,
    "message": "Successfully counted documents",
    "status": "success"
  }
}
```

## How to Use in a No-Code Workflow

1. **Add the Node:** Drag and drop the **Fetch Data** node into your workflow canvas.
2. **Open Settings:** Click on the node to open its configuration panel.
3. **Add a Description:** Optionally describe its purpose (e.g., “Fetch all employee records”).
4. **Select Action Type:** Choose one of the three options:

   * Fetch All Documents
   * Fetch Specific Document
   * Count Documents
5. **Choose Collection:** Select your database collection such as `test3 (production)`.
6. **Save Changes:** Click **Save Changes** to confirm your setup.
7. **Run the Workflow:** When triggered, the node fetches data and passes it to the next node automatically.

---

## Best Practices

* Always verify that you are fetching from the correct **collection**.
* Use **Count Documents** to check totals before performing actions like filtering or deleting.
* If you only need specific records, use **Fetch Specific Document** to avoid unnecessary data load.
* Combine this node with **Filter**, **Text Generation**, or **Email Sending** nodes for dynamic workflows.
* Keep the **Node Description** meaningful so others can easily understand its purpose.

---

## Example Workflow Integration

Here’s an example of how this node might fit into a workflow:

1. **Trigger Node:** The workflow begins when an admin clicks “View Records.”
2. **Fetch Data Node:** Retrieves all user data from `test3 (production)`.
3. **Text Generation Node:** Summarizes the fetched data into a readable format.
4. **Send Email Node:** Sends a formatted summary to the admin’s inbox.

This workflow automates the process of pulling, formatting, and sharing database information.

---

## Common Errors

* **Missing Collection Name:** The node cannot run without selecting a valid collection.
* **Invalid Action Type:** Ensure one of the supported options is chosen.
* **Empty Results:** Happens when no records exist in the selected collection.
* **Connection Timeout:** Check your database connection or permissions if data fails to load.
