**Type:** Read / Query Node

## Overview

The **Query Data Node** allows you to search, filter, and retrieve records from your connected database collection within a no-code workflow.
You can use this node to fetch specific rows based on filters, get all data, or even use plain language to describe what you want to retrieve — no SQL required.

---

## Description

This node helps you connect to your selected database table (or collection) and return matching records as structured JSON.
You can apply multiple filters, combine them with AND/OR logic, sort the data, limit how many records you want, and even paginate large data sets.
The output from this node can then be passed to other nodes like “Display Data,” “Generate Text,” or “Create Chart.”

---

## Input Parameters

Below are the input settings you can configure in the node:

* **Node Description:**
  Optional text to describe what this node does (for internal clarity).

* **Select Query Type:**
  Choose between

  * *Query Data* → use structured filters with fields and operators.
  * *Natural Language Query* → type a plain-text instruction like “Find all active users created after January 2024”.

* **Table Name:**
  Choose the table or collection you want to query, for example `test3 (production)`.

* **Query Fields:**
  Add one or more filters to narrow down the search. Each filter includes:

  * a field (for example, `id`, `name`, or `email`)
  * an operator (`=`, `!=`, `contains`, etc.)
  * a value (which can also come from an earlier node’s output).

* **Query Combination Type:**
  Defines how multiple filters are joined.

  * `AND` → all conditions must match.
  * `OR` → any condition can match.

* **Order By:**
  Select the field by which you want to sort the results (for example, `name` or `created_at`).

* **Order Direction:**
  Choose `Ascending` or `Descending` for the sorting order.

* **Limit:**
  Specify how many records you want to retrieve at most.

* **Start After / Offset:**
  Use this to skip records (for pagination).

---

## Output Parameters

The node produces several pieces of information after running:

* **tableName:**
  The full name of the collection that was queried, for example `production:test3`.

* **queryId:**
  A unique ID automatically assigned to this specific query run. It helps with logs and debugging.

* **data:**
  The main output — an array (list) of records returned by the query. Each record is an object containing fields like `id`, `name`, `email`, and others from your database.

* **message:**
  A readable message summarizing what happened, for example “Successfully fetched 13 documents.”

* **status:**
  Indicates success or failure of the operation (e.g., `success`, `error`).

---

## Output Type

The output is returned in **JSON format**.
The key `data` holds an array of record objects. Each object contains all fields from that record in your database.
This JSON can easily be passed to other nodes for further processing, display, or transformation.

## Example Usage

### Example 1 – Query Data (structured filters)

**Node settings:**

```json
{
  "selectQueryType": "Query Data",
  "tableName": "test3 (production)",
  "queryCombinationType": "AND",
  "orderBy": "name",
  "orderDirection": "Ascending",
  "limit": 50
}
```

**Expected output:**

```json
{
  "output": {
    "tableName": "production:test3",
    "queryId": "a5aeb97e-44f3-48d2-9fe6-ad2e475c527f",
    "data": [
      {
        "id": "10",
        "created_at": "2023-10-01T12:00:00.000Z",
        "name": "Amanda Taylor",
        "bio": "Amanda Taylor is a journalist covering environmental issues and climate change...",
        "active": "yes",
        "email": "amanda.taylor@newsagency.org",
        "status": null
      },
      {
        "id": "5",
        "created_at": "2023-05-12T11:00:00.000Z",
        "name": "David Wilson",
        "bio": "David Wilson is a project manager in the construction industry...",
        "active": "yes",
        "email": "david.wilson@constructionco.net",
        "status": null
      }
    ],
    "message": "Successfully fetched 2 documents",
    "status": "success"
  }
}
```

### Example 2 – Natural Language Query

**Node settings:**

```json
{
  "selectQueryType": "Natural Language Query",
  "tableName": "test3 (production)",
  "naturalLanguage": "Find all active users created after January 2023 ordered by created_at descending",
  "limit": 20
}
```

**Expected output:**

```json
{
  "output": {
    "tableName": "production:test3",
    "queryId": "b12c98fa-7e11-4a77-9cb8-8d7a7e901234",
    "data": [
      { "id": "10", "name": "Amanda Taylor", "created_at": "2023-10-01T12:00:00.000Z", "active": "yes" },
      { "id": "5", "name": "David Wilson", "created_at": "2023-05-12T11:00:00.000Z", "active": "yes" }
    ],
    "message": "Successfully fetched 2 documents",
    "status": "success"
  }
}
```

## How to Use in a No-Code Workflow

1. Drag and drop the **Query Data** node into your workflow.
2. Click the node to open its settings.
3. Optionally give it a clear description like “Fetch recent users.”
4. Choose the **Query Type**.

   * Use “Query Data” if you want structured filters.
   * Use “Natural Language Query” if you want to type instructions.
5. Pick your **Table Name** (for example, `test3 (production)`).
6. If using structured filters, click **Add Field** and set up each condition.
7. Combine filters using “AND” or “OR.”
8. Choose sorting, limit, and offset if needed.
9. Click **Save Changes**.
10. Connect this node to the next step — such as a display node or a text generation node — to use the results.

---

## Best Practices

* Always use a **limit** to avoid pulling huge datasets.
* When you only need one specific record, query using a unique field like `id`.
* Use **consistent date formats** (ISO format: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ`) for better filtering and sorting.
* Combine **orderBy** with **limit** to get “top N” or “latest” results.
* When using **Natural Language Query**, double-check that the interpreted query makes sense.
* Keep your **queryId** for debugging or workflow tracking.

---

## Example Workflow Integration

Here are common ways to use this node:

* **Form Input → Query Data → Display Results**
  A user enters a search term, Query Data fetches matches, and a Display node shows them.

* **Schedule Trigger → Query Data → Email Node**
  Runs daily, fetches recent updates, and emails the summary.

* **Button Click → Query Data → Chart Node**
  A dashboard button triggers Query Data, and the returned data builds a visualization.

---

## Common Errors and Fixes

* **Empty results:**
  Your filters may not match any records. Try loosening the conditions.

* **Invalid table name:**
  Double-check you selected the correct table or environment (for example, `test3 (production)`).

* **Missing required field:**
  You might have left out a necessary input or not connected upstream nodes correctly.

* **Sorting not working:**
  The `orderBy` field might be missing or inconsistent (string vs. date type).

* **Permission errors:**
  Ensure you have access to the database and correct credentials.
