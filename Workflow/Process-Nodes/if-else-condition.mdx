**Type:** Conditional Branching

## Overview

The **If/Else Condition** node helps you create **conditional logic branches** in your workflow.
It checks a condition you define and then decides which path to take — **True** or **False** — based on the result.

This allows you to make your workflow “think” and automatically handle different situations.
For example, you can send a message only if the sender’s email matches a specific address, or trigger a notification only if a value meets certain criteria.

---

## Description

This node compares one piece of data (like an email address, name, or number) against a value you choose.
Depending on whether the condition is **true** or **false**, the workflow continues along the **True path** or the **False path**.

It’s commonly used to:

* Filter or sort data.
* Control workflow decisions.
* Automate actions based on user input or system data.

## Input Parameters

| **Parameter**        | **Type** | **Description**                                                              | **Required** |
| -------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| **Source Node**      | `string` | The node that provides the input data to check.                              | ✅            |
| **Parameter**        | `string` | The specific data field to evaluate (for example, `senderEmail`).            | ✅            |
| **Operator**         | `string` | The comparison method to use, such as `Equals`, `Not Equals`, or `Contains`. | ✅            |
| **Value**            | `string` | The value to compare against the selected parameter.                         | ✅            |
| **Node Description** | `string` | An optional text field to describe what this condition checks.               | ❌            |

## Output Parameters

| **Parameter** | **Type**  | **Description**                                                                                                             |
| ------------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **condition** | `boolean` | Shows whether the defined condition evaluated to **true** or **false**.                                                     |
| **Next Step** | `string`  | Indicates which path the workflow will follow next — the **True** branch or the **False** branch — depending on the result. |

---

## Output Type

The output is a **Boolean** value:

* **True** → The condition matched, and the workflow will follow the **True path**.
* **False** → The condition did not match, and the workflow will follow the **False path**.

## Example Usage

### Example 1: Check the Sender’s Email

**Input:**

```json
{
  "sourceNode": "Send Mail",
  "parameter": "Input: senderEmail",
  "operator": "Equals",
  "value": "kolekarharshada08@gmail.com"
}
```

**Execution Output:**

```json
{
  "output": {
    "condition": false,
    "Next Step": "Return to Default Path"
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**
The workflow checked if the sender’s email matched `kolekarharshada08@gmail.com`.
Since it was actually `harshada@notifs.worqhat.com`, the result was **False**, and the workflow continued on the **False branch**.

---

### Example 2: Match a Username

**Input:**

```json
{
  "sourceNode": "User Info",
  "parameter": "Input: userName",
  "operator": "Equals",
  "value": "Alex"
}
```

**Expected Output:**

```json
{
  "output": {
    "condition": true,
    "Next Step": "Send Welcome Email"
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**
Because the user’s name was “Alex,” the condition was **True**, and the workflow moved to the **Send Welcome Email** step.

## How to Use in a No-Code Workflow

Follow these simple steps to use the **If/Else Condition** node in your workflow:

1. **Add the Node**
   Drag and drop the **If/Else Condition** node into your workflow editor.

2. **Connect a Source Node**
   Choose the previous node that provides the data to check (for example, “Send Mail” or “API Response”).

3. **Select a Parameter**
   Pick which piece of data you want to evaluate — such as an email address or a status code.

4. **Choose an Operator**
   Select how the comparison should be done (`Equals`, `Contains`, `Greater Than`, etc.).

5. **Set a Value**
   Enter the value you want to compare against.

6. **Connect the True and False Paths**

   * Connect the **True path** to the action you want if the condition is met.
   * Connect the **False path** to the action you want if it’s not met.

7. **Run the Workflow**
   When executed, the node automatically decides which path to follow based on your condition.

---

## Best Practices

* Use **clear, descriptive names** for your nodes and conditions.
* Double-check that the **parameter** exactly matches the field name from your source node.
* For string comparisons, remember that some systems may be **case-sensitive**.
* Keep your workflow organized by grouping related conditions together.
* Always test your workflow with both True and False outcomes to ensure everything works correctly.

---

## Example Workflow Integration

**Scenario:**
You want to automatically reply to emails only from a specific sender.

**Workflow Steps:**

1. **Trigger Node:** Receive Email
2. **If/Else Condition:**

   * Source Node: `Send Mail`
   * Parameter: `Input: senderEmail`
   * Operator: `Equals`
   * Value: `kolekarharshada08@gmail.com`
3. **True Path:** Send an auto-reply email.
4. **False Path:** Log the message and stop the workflow.

**Result:**
Only the selected sender receives an automatic reply, while others are ignored.

## Common Errors

| **Error Message**                      | **Possible Cause**                                     | **Solution**                                                       |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| *“Parameter not found in Source Node”* | The selected parameter doesn’t exist or is misspelled. | Double-check the parameter name in the source node output.         |
| *“Invalid Operator”*                   | An unsupported or misspelled operator was selected.    | Use valid operators such as `Equals`, `Not Equals`, or `Contains`. |
| *“Value missing for condition”*        | The comparison value field is empty.                   | Enter a valid comparison value.                                    |
| *Condition always returns False*       | Data type mismatch or incorrect input mapping.         | Check that your parameter and value use the same data format.      |

 **Summary:**
The **If/Else Condition Node** is a simple yet powerful way to make your workflow behave intelligently.
It checks conditions, chooses the right path, and ensures your automation reacts exactly the way you need — no coding required.
