# For Loop Process

## Description

The For Loop Process node allows you to repeat a group of workflow steps multiple times.
You define how many times the loop should run using a start value and an end value.
Each iteration runs the same inner actions.

This is useful when a task needs to be executed several times, such as sending multiple notifications, performing repeated calculations, or processing multiple items.

---

## Input Parameters

start
A number that defines the first value of the loop.
Required.

end
A number that defines the final value of the loop.
Required.

step
A number that defines how much to increase on each loop cycle.
Optional. Default is 1.

The loop repeats from start to end, increasing by step until the end value is reached.

---

## Output Parameters

iterations
Number of iterations performed.

totalIterations
Total count of times the loop ran.

Final Output
A summary of the loop execution that can be used by the next step in the workflow.

---

## Output Type

This node produces an iterative output.
It runs a set of inner steps multiple times and returns results from each cycle.

---

## Example Usage

Example 1
Loop runs five times, from 1 to 5.

Input

```
{
  "start": 1,
  "end": 5
}
```

Expected Output

```
{
  "iterations": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
  "totalIterations": 5
}
```

---

Example 2
Loop runs four times, from 0 to 3.

Input

```
{
  "start": 0,
  "end": 3
}
```

Expected Output

```
{
  "iterations": [0, 1, 2, 3],
  "totalIterations": 4
}
```

## How to Use in a No-Code Workflow

1. Add the For Loop Process node to your workflow.
2. Set the start value.
3. Set the end value.
4. Set step if needed.
5. Place one or more nodes inside the loop.
   These nodes will run every time the loop cycles.
6. Connect the next node after the loop to continue workflow execution.
7. Save and run your workflow.

---

## Best Practices

• Test with a small range first.
• Avoid very large end values to prevent performance issues.
• Always place at least one node inside the loop.
• Use logging to confirm iterations run correctly.

---

## Example Workflow Integration

Scenario
You want to send five reminder messages.

Steps

1. Add a trigger node.
2. Add a For Loop Process node and set start to 1 and end to 5.
3. Inside the loop, add a notification or message-sending node.
4. After the loop, add a summary node to indicate all messages were sent.

Result
The inner action runs five times.

---

## Common Errors

Missing start or end
Both must be set for the loop to execute.

Loop does not run
At least one node must be placed inside the loop.

Too many iterations
Large ranges can slow down or block execution.

Empty output
If no inner nodes produce output, results will be empty.
