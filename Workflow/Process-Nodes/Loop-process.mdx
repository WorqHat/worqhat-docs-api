## Overview

The **Loop Process Node** is used to repeat a set of actions several times inside your workflow.
It helps you run the same task automatically for a fixed number of iterations or items, without needing to manually duplicate steps.

This node is helpful when you need to process multiple records, perform repetitive operations, or create batch tasks — such as sending several messages, checking multiple values, or looping through a list of data.

---

## Description

The **Loop Process Node** works by running a group of connected actions in a **loop**.
You can define a **loop variable** that represents the current iteration (like `a` or `i`), and you can specify how many times the loop should run by setting a **maximum iteration count**.

Each time the loop runs, the workflow uses the loop variable’s value for that round.
Once it finishes all the iterations, the loop stops automatically.

If no actions are placed inside the loop, it still completes the planned iterations but performs no inner actions.

---

## Input Parameters

**Node Description**
An optional text description explaining what this loop is designed to do.

**Loop Variable**
The name of the variable used in each loop iteration.
For example, if you enter `a`, then each round of the loop will reference `a` as the current count or value.

**Maximum Iterations**
The total number of times the loop should repeat.
This setting prevents the workflow from looping endlessly.

All of these inputs can be set directly in the **Node Settings** panel.

---

## Output Parameters

**condition (loop result)** — Indicates whether the loop ran successfully or not.
**totalIterations** — Shows how many total iterations were planned for this loop.
**completedIterations** — Displays how many times the loop actually completed its actions.
**batchesProcessed** — If your workflow runs items in groups, this value shows how many batches were processed.
**Loop Variable Output** — Shows the final value of the loop variable after all iterations are complete.

---

## Output Type

The output of this node is **iterative data**.
It includes numeric results such as how many iterations were completed and the final state of your loop variable.
You can use this information in later steps of your workflow.

## Example Usage

### Example 1: Simple 10-Iteration Loop

**Input:**

```json
{
  "loopVariable": "a",
  "maximumIterations": 10
}
```

**Output:**

```json
{
  "totalIterations": 10,
  "completedIterations": 10,
  "batchesProcessed": 1,
  "a": null
}
```

**Explanation:**
This example creates a loop using the variable `a` that runs ten times.
Since there are no actions inside the loop, it finishes immediately and returns summary details like total and completed iterations.

---

### Example 2: Process Multiple Items

**Input:**

```json
{
  "loopVariable": "item",
  "maximumIterations": 5
}
```

**Expected Output:**

```json
{
  "totalIterations": 5,
  "completedIterations": 5,
  "batchesProcessed": 1,
  "item": "last_processed_value"
}
```

**Explanation:**
This setup loops through five items using the variable `item`.
Each iteration processes one item, and after all iterations, the last processed value is returned.

## How to Use in a No-Code Workflow

1. **Add the Node**
   Drag and drop the **Loop Process Node** into your workflow canvas.

2. **Set the Loop Variable**
   Enter a name for your loop variable (like `item` or `a`).
   This variable represents the current count or item in each iteration.

3. **Define the Maximum Iterations**
   Specify how many times you want the loop to run.
   This ensures the loop stops after the desired number of rounds.

4. **Add Actions Inside the Loop**
   Place the nodes or actions that you want to repeat **inside** the loop.

5. **Connect the Next Step**
   Once the loop finishes, connect the next node or action for what should happen next.

6. **Run the Workflow**
   Execute the workflow to see the loop in action.
   Review the results to confirm that all iterations ran successfully.

---

## Best Practices

- Always set a **maximum iteration limit** to avoid infinite loops.
- Start with a **small number of iterations** (like 3 to 5) during testing.
- Give your **loop variable** a short, meaningful name that reflects its purpose.
- Combine the Loop Process Node with **If/Else Conditions** for smarter decision-making inside loops.
- Use the loop for **batch operations** — such as processing lists, updating records, or sending multiple messages.

---

## Example Workflow Integration

**Scenario:**
You want to send a personalized email to 10 users.

**Workflow Steps:**

1. Add a **Trigger Node** to start your workflow (for example, “User List Loaded”).
2. Add a **Loop Process Node** and set:

   - Loop Variable: `user`
   - Maximum Iterations: `10`

3. Inside the loop, add a **Send Email Node** to send a personalized message to each user.
4. After the loop, connect a **Summary Node** or **Log Node** to record that all messages were sent.

**Result:**
The workflow automatically runs 10 times — one for each user — and stops when all iterations are done.

---

## Common Errors

**Loop variable not defined**
The loop variable field was left blank.
→ Always provide a name like `a` or `item`.

**Maximum iterations missing**
You must set the total number of iterations.
→ This prevents infinite loops.

**No actions inside the loop**
The node has nothing to process.
→ Add at least one action or node inside the loop.

**Loop did not start**
The input data was empty or invalid.
→ Make sure the previous node provides valid data for looping.

---

## Summary

The **Loop Process Node** lets you automate repetitive actions easily — no coding required.
You can repeat steps a specific number of times, work through lists of items, or perform batch operations automatically.
It’s a simple yet powerful way to make your workflow **smarter, faster, and more efficient**.
