## Overview

The **Return State Node** is the final step of a workflow.
It’s used to return the final **status**, **message**, and **data** back to the user or connected system.

Think of it as the **“return statement”** in a workflow — once this node runs, the process ends and a response is sent.

---

## Description

This node gathers outputs from previous steps and organizes them into a structured final response.
It doesn’t perform any calculations or actions by itself.

You can choose what to include in the final response — for example, results from an API call, processed data, or user inputs.

Common fields:

* **status** – shows if the process succeeded or failed (e.g., 200 for success).
* **message** – gives a short description of the result.
* **data** – contains the actual information or result you want to send back.

Use double curly braces `{{ }}` to reference values from earlier nodes, like:
`{{UserInputNode.output.email}}` or `{{DatabaseNode.output.recordId}}`.

---

## Input Parameters

This node does **not** take direct inputs.
It simply collects and returns data already generated by previous nodes.

If you need to include specific values, use `{{nodeId.output.field}}` to map them into the final output.

---

## Output Parameters

The Return State Node produces three main outputs:

* **status** – A code such as `200` (success) or `400` (error).
* **message** – A short note describing the outcome.
* **data** – A JSON object that holds all the final results.

---

## Output Type

The output is a **structured JSON response** that marks the end of the workflow.
It typically includes a numeric status code, a descriptive message, and an object with the final data.

## Example Usage

### Example 1: Returning a User Profile

**Input:**

```json
{
  "input": {
    "NAME": "Jacob Williams",
    "EMAIL": "jacobwilliams@worqhat.com",
    "CONTACT_NUMBER": "123456789",
    "ADDRESS": "Building Number: 30 Street Name: Rockefeller Plaza Street Address: Top of the Rock Observation Deck State: NY City: New York Post Code: 10112"
  }
}
```

**Output:**

```
Status: 200  
Response:
{
  "name": "Jacob Williams",
  "email": "jacobwilliams@worqhat.com",
  "contact number": "123456789",
  "address": "Building Number: 30 Street Name: Rockefeller Plaza Street Address: Top of the Rock Observation Deck State: NY City: New York Post Code: 10112"
}
```

This example shows how the node gathers user data and formats it neatly into the final response.

### Example 2: Returning an Order Summary

You can use this node to return results from an order processing workflow.

**Configuration:**

```
status: 200  
message: "Order processed successfully"  
data: {
  "orderId": "{{OrderNode.output.id}}",
  "totalAmount": "{{BillingNode.output.amount}}",
  "confirmationTime": "{{TimeNode.output.timestamp}}"
}
```

**Expected Output:**

```json
{
  "status": 200,
  "message": "Order processed successfully",
  "data": {
    "orderId": "ORD-4582",
    "totalAmount": 250.75,
    "confirmationTime": "2025-10-29T10:30:00Z"
  }
}
```

## How to Use in a No-Code Workflow

1. Add the **Return State Node** as the final step of your workflow.
2. Map data from earlier nodes using `{{nodeId.output.field}}`.
3. Define the **status** (e.g., 200) and **message** (e.g., “Process completed successfully”).
4. Include all the data you want to return under the **data** field.
5. Run or test your workflow — this node will output the final JSON response.

---

## Best Practices

* Always place this node **at the end** of your workflow.
* Use meaningful **status codes** (200 for success, 400 for error).
* Keep your **messages** short and descriptive.
* Map only the necessary data fields to keep the response clean.
* Test the workflow with both successful and failed cases to ensure reliability.

## Example Workflow Integration

**Scenario:** Customer registration workflow

**Steps:**

1. Input Node collects customer details.
2. Validation Node checks required fields.
3. Database Node saves the record.
4. Return State Node sends the final success response.

**Final Output:**

```json
{
  "status": 200,
  "message": "Customer registered successfully",
  "data": {
    "name": "Jacob Williams",
    "email": "jacobwilliams@worqhat.com",
    "contact": "123456789"
  }
}
```

This setup ensures the process ends with a clear, easy-to-understand result.

---

## Common Errors

* **Missing Output Reference:** You might have referenced a node that doesn’t exist. Check your `{{ }}` mappings.
* **Empty Response:** Happens when `data` is not defined. Make sure you include at least one field.
* **Invalid Data Type:** Occurs if data is incorrectly formatted (for example, using text where an object is expected).
* **Workflow Did Not Return:** The Return State Node must be the last node in the workflow.


---

## Summary

The **Return State Node** is the final touchpoint in any workflow.
It collects all results, wraps them neatly in a structured response, and sends them out.

Use it to give your workflows a professional, consistent, and complete ending — clear, simple, and ready for integration anywhere.
