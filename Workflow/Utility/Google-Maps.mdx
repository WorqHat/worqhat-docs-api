## Overview

The **Google Maps Node** allows your workflow to connect with Google Maps services and retrieve various location-based data or features.
This can include operations such as finding routes, geocoding addresses, fetching nearby places, or analyzing map data, depending on the selected option.

It serves as a convenient bridge between your workflow and Google Maps functionalities without requiring direct API setup or code.

---

## Description

The **Google Maps Node** enables you to use features of Google Maps within your workflow.
You can select a specific function (like “get directions”, “find nearby places”, or “get distance”) through the `option` parameter.

Once executed, this node interacts with Google Maps and returns structured results such as processing time, count, and a unique identifier for the request.
It’s ideal for automating tasks that involve location lookup, distance calculation, travel planning, or region-based analysis.

## Input Parameters

The **Google Maps Node** accepts the following input parameters:

* **option** *(string, required)*
  Defines which Google Maps feature or function you want to perform.
  Examples:

  * `"geocode"` – Convert address to coordinates.
  * `"reverse-geocode"` – Convert coordinates to an address.
  * `"get-directions"` – Retrieve route details between two points.
  * `"get-distance"` – Calculate travel distance and duration.
  * `"nearby-search"` – Find nearby locations or landmarks.

**Notes:**

* The value must be one of the supported options available in the integration.
* The input must be clear and relevant to the desired operation (for example, “get-distance” requires location data).

---

## Output Parameters

The node returns key details about the operation, which help in identifying and processing the result.

* **processingCount** *(number)*
  The number of items or results processed in the Google Maps request.

* **processingTime** *(string)*
  The total time taken to complete the Google Maps operation, expressed in an ISO timestamp or duration format.

* **processingId** *(string)*
  A unique identifier assigned to this specific Google Maps request, useful for debugging or tracking.

---

## Output Type

**Output Type:** Text (Structured JSON Result)

The output of this node is returned as structured text in JSON format, which may include location details, travel times, or place information depending on the `option` used.
Downstream nodes can access these outputs using variables like:

```
{{googleMaps.output.processingCount}}
{{googleMaps.output.processingTime}}
{{googleMaps.output.processingId}}
```

## Example Usage

### Example 1: Get Coordinates from an Address

```json
{
  "option": "geocode"
}
```

**Expected Output:**

```json
{
  "processingCount": 1,
  "processingTime": "2025-10-27T11:22:00Z",
  "processingId": "gmaps-req-98213"
}
```

---

### Example 2: Calculate Distance Between Two Points

```json
{
  "option": "get-distance"
}
```

**Expected Output:**

```json
{
  "processingCount": 1,
  "processingTime": "2025-10-27T11:23:00Z",
  "processingId": "gmaps-req-12478"
}
```

## How to Use in a No-Code Workflow

1. **Add the Google Maps Node**

   * Drag and drop the **Google Maps Node** into your workflow under the “Utility” category.

2. **Set the Option**

   * In the node settings, specify what you want Google Maps to do by entering a value in the `option` field (e.g., `"get-distance"`).

3. **Provide Supporting Data**

   * If your selected option requires input (like addresses or coordinates), use previous nodes to supply those values.

4. **Connect to Downstream Nodes**

   * Pass the extracted or computed map information to another node (for example, display distance results in an email or store them in a database).

5. **Test the Workflow**

   * Run a test to verify that the Google Maps node executes correctly and returns the expected details.

---

## Best Practices

* Always double-check the `option` value to ensure it matches the operation you intend to perform.
* Combine this node with input nodes (like form submissions or database fetches) to dynamically provide location data.
* Use the returned `processingId` for troubleshooting or tracking multiple map-related requests.
* Ensure that your workflow has the necessary permissions or API access to interact with Google Maps services.
* Use descriptive naming conventions for map-related nodes (e.g., “Get Office Distance” or “Locate Delivery Area”).

## Common Errors

* **"Missing option"**
  **Cause:** The `option` parameter was not provided.
  **Solution:** Always specify a valid Google Maps function (e.g., `"geocode"`).

* **"Invalid option value"**
  **Cause:** The selected `option` is not supported.
  **Solution:** Use one of the predefined supported values.

* **"Request failed"**
  **Cause:** The Google Maps API could not process the request due to invalid or missing data.
  **Solution:** Verify that all required fields (like address or coordinates) are provided.

* **"API connection error"**
  **Cause:** Network or API authentication issues.
  **Solution:** Check your API configuration or reconnect the Google Maps service.
