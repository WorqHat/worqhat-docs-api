## Overview

The **Calendar Fetch Events** node retrieves a list of events from a connected calendar within a specific date range.
It allows you to automatically collect event data such as titles, times, participants, meeting links, and organizers.

This node is ideal for building workflows that depend on upcoming or past events — for example, generating daily reports, summarizing meetings, or syncing event details with external systems like CRMs or chat tools.

---

## Description

The **Calendar Fetch Events** node connects to your calendar service and pulls event information based on your defined criteria.
You can specify:

- A **calendar ID** to fetch events from a particular calendar.
- A **start date** and **end date** to define the time window.

Once executed, this node returns a structured list of events, including details such as event titles, descriptions, locations, participants, meeting links, and creation timestamps.

This node does not modify your calendar; it only reads and provides event data for use in other parts of the workflow.

---

## Input Parameters

The **Calendar Fetch Events** node requires the following parameters to define which events to retrieve.

- **calendarId**
  The unique identifier of the calendar to fetch events from.
  Example: `"primary"` or a custom calendar ID.

- **startDate**
  The ISO-formatted start date and time from which events should be fetched.
  Example: `"2025-11-01T00:00:00Z"`.

- **endDate**
  The ISO-formatted end date and time until which events should be fetched.
  Example: `"2025-11-07T23:59:59Z"`.

**Notes:**

- All date values must be in **ISO 8601** format for compatibility.
- The date range can include both past and upcoming events.
- You can access input values using:

  ```
  {{calendarFetchEvents.input.calendarId}}
  {{calendarFetchEvents.input.startDate}}
  {{calendarFetchEvents.input.endDate}}
  ```

## Example Usage

### Example 1: Fetch Events for the Current Week

```json
{
  "calendarId": "primary",
  "startDate": "2025-11-01T00:00:00Z",

      "meetLink": "https://meet.google.com/abc-defg-hij"
    },
    {
      "eventId": "evt_23457",
      "title": "Product Review Session",
      "startDate": "2025-11-04T13:00:00Z",
      "endDate": "2025-11-04T14:00:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Example 2: Fetch Events for a Specific Calendar

```json
{
  "calendarId": "marketing_team_calendar",
  "startDate": "2025-11-10T00:00:00Z",

## How to Use in a No-Code Workflow

1. **Add the Calendar Fetch Events Node**
   Drag and drop the node into your workflow from the Utilities category.

2. **Connect a Trigger Node**
   Link a trigger node, such as a **Time Trigger** or **Email Trigger**, to decide when to fetch events (e.g., daily or weekly).

3. **Configure Input Parameters**

   - Enter the `calendarId` (e.g., `"primary"`).
   - Define the `startDate` and `endDate` for the event range.

4. **Connect to Downstream Nodes**
   Use the event data in downstream nodes like **Text Generation** (for summaries), **Slack Message** (for notifications), or **Google Sheets** (for logging).

5. **Test the Workflow**
   Run a manual test to verify the data fetched matches your calendar events.

6. **Save and Activate**
   Once tested, activate the workflow for scheduled event retrieval.

---

## Best Practices

- Always use valid ISO 8601 date and time formats to avoid data errors.
- Keep the date range short (e.g., one week or one month) for faster performance.
- Use the `timezone` output to align events across regions.
- Combine this node with a **Text Generation Node** to automatically summarize daily or weekly meetings.
- If your calendar has multiple sources, fetch and merge results from separate nodes.
- Regularly refresh your authentication or calendar connection credentials.

---

## Example Workflow Integration

**Use Case:** Generate a daily summary of meetings and post it to Slack.

**Workflow Steps:**

1. **Trigger Node:** Time Trigger (Runs every morning at 8 AM.)
2. **Utility Node:** Calendar Fetch Events Node (Retrieves all meetings for the day.)
3. **AI Node:** Text Generation (Summarizes the fetched events into a short message.)
4. **Utility Node:** Slack Message (Sends the summary to the team channel.)

## Common Errors

- **"Invalid calendarId"**
  **Cause:** The specified calendar ID is incorrect or inaccessible.
  **Solution:** Verify the ID and ensure proper permissions.

- **"Invalid date format"**
  **Cause:** Dates are not in ISO 8601 format.
  **Solution:** Use properly formatted timestamps, e.g., `"2025-11-01T09:00:00Z"`.

- **"No events found"**
  **Cause:** The date range or calendar is empty.
  **Solution:** Adjust the date range or verify that the calendar contains events.

- **"Connection error"**
  **Cause:** The integration with the calendar service failed.
  **Solution:** Reconnect your calendar integration and try again.
