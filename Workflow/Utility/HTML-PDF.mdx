# HTML to PDF

**Category:** File Conversion
**Type:** Output Node
**Overview:**
The **HTML to PDF Node** converts HTML content into a downloadable PDF file. It allows you to design and format professional-looking documents such as reports, invoices, articles, or certificates using HTML and CSS, and then automatically generate a PDF file.

---

### Description

The **HTML to PDF Node** is used to transform structured HTML content into a PDF document. You can either manually write your HTML using the built-in HTML editor or let the AI automatically generate a template for you. Once executed, the node returns a file URL to the generated PDF, which can be downloaded or used in subsequent workflow steps such as “Send Mail” or “Upload File”.

---

### Input Parameters

The node accepts the following inputs:

* **HTML Template / HTML Content:**
  The complete HTML structure you want to convert. This includes `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags along with embedded CSS for styling.

* **PDF Size:**
  The paper size for the PDF document (e.g., A4, Letter). The default and most commonly used is `A4`.

* **AI Template Description (Optional):**
  A natural language prompt that describes the kind of HTML template you want the AI to create. You can describe layout, colors, and content ideas, and the system will generate a ready-to-edit HTML structure.

---

### Output Parameters

After successful execution, the node returns:

* **File URL:**
  A secure URL where the generated PDF file is stored and can be accessed or downloaded.

* **File ID:**
  A unique identifier for the generated PDF file within the system.

* **PDF Size:**
  The paper size used for generating the PDF.

* **Generated Timestamp:**
  The exact date and time when the PDF was created.

---

### Output Type

The node outputs a **file object**, which includes both metadata and a downloadable link to the generated PDF file. This file can be referenced or passed into other nodes such as email or storage nodes.

### How to Use in a No-Code Workflow

1. **Add the “HTML to PDF” node** to your workflow.
2. In **Node Settings**, write or paste your HTML code in the editor.

   * You can use text, images, CSS styling, and variables.
3. Choose the **PDF Size** (e.g., A4 or Letter).
4. Optionally, describe the desired layout and click **“Generate Template”** to let AI design the HTML automatically.
5. Click **Save Changes**.
6. Connect the output of this node to a node like **Send Mail** or **Return Response** to share or view the PDF.

---

### Best Practices

* Keep your HTML simple and properly structured to ensure accurate rendering.
* Use inline CSS or internal `<style>` blocks for consistent formatting.
* Avoid external image URLs unless they are publicly accessible.
* Always preview your HTML using the built-in editor before generating the PDF.
* Use clear headings, spacing, and color contrast for readability.

---

### Example Workflow Integration

A typical use case for this node might be:

1. **Fetch Data** from your database.
2. **Generate HTML Template** dynamically using the data.
3. **Convert HTML to PDF** using this node.
4. **Send Mail** with the generated PDF attached.

This allows you to automate PDF report generation and distribution without writing code.

---

### Common Errors

* **Invalid HTML:** Unclosed tags or malformed CSS can cause PDF generation to fail.
* **Unsupported Fonts or Images:** External resources might not load if hosted privately.
* **Large HTML Content:** Very long HTML pages may take extra processing time or fail to render completely.
