## Overview

The **Calendar Add Event** node allows you to automatically create events on a connected calendar.
It’s ideal for scheduling meetings, setting reminders, or automating event creation based on triggers — such as form submissions, email requests, or AI-generated scheduling suggestions.

With this node, you can define event details like title, description, start and end times, participants, and even automatically include a Google Meet link if desired.

---

## Description

The **Calendar Add Event** node helps automate the process of adding events to your calendar.
Once connected to a calendar account (like Google Calendar), this node can create events with all necessary details, including the meeting title, time, location, participants, and online meeting links.

It can be combined with other nodes to automatically schedule events based on workflow data — for example:

* Scheduling meetings after receiving an email inquiry.
* Creating task deadlines after project completion.
* Generating calendar reminders from AI-generated text or forms.

When executed, the node securely communicates with your calendar service to create the event and returns details such as the event ID, Google Meet link (if applicable), and status confirmation.

---

## Input Parameters

The **Calendar Add Event** node accepts several parameters that define the event’s details.

* **calendarId**
  The unique identifier of the calendar where the event will be created.

* **attachments**

* **description** 
  A short description or agenda of the event. Supports plain text or limited HTML formatting.

* **addGoogleMeet** 
  When set to `true`, automatically generates and attaches a Google Meet video conferencing link to the event.

* **startDate**
  The start date and time of the event in ISO format (e.g., `2025-10-27T09:00:00Z`).

* **endDate**
  The end date and time of the event in ISO format. Must be later than the start time.

* **location** 
  The location or venue for the event (e.g., “Conference Room A” or “Online”).

* **guestsCanInviteOthers** *(boolean, optional)*
  If `true`, allows invited guests to add others to the event.

**Notes:**

* Date and time must follow proper ISO formatting for successful creation.

## Example Usage

### Example 1: Add a Meeting with Google Meet

```json
{
  "calendarId": "primary",
  "title": "Project Sync Meeting",
  "description": "Weekly project sync with the development team.",

### Example 2: Add a Physical Location Event

```json
{
  "calendarId": "team_calendar",
  "title": "Team Strategy Meeting",
  "description": "Quarterly roadmap discussion.",

## How to Use in a No-Code Workflow

1. **Add the Calendar Add Event Node**
   Drag and drop the node into your workflow canvas.

2. **Connect a Trigger Node**
   Link a trigger (e.g., Time Trigger, Email Trigger, or Webhook Trigger) to determine when the event should be created.

3. **Configure Input Parameters**

   * Enter the `calendarId` of your connected account.
   * Set the `title`, `startDate`, and `endDate`.
   * Optionally, enable Google Meet integration and add participants.

4. **Connect to Downstream Nodes**
   Use the output (like `eventLink` or `meetLink`) in downstream actions — for instance, sending notifications or reminders.

5. **Test the Workflow**
   Run the workflow and verify that the event appears correctly in your calendar.

6. **Save and Activate**
   Once confirmed, save your workflow to automate event creation.

---

## Best Practices

* Always ensure your time zone and ISO timestamps are accurate to avoid scheduling errors.
* Use descriptive titles and descriptions for easier event management.
* When scheduling recurring meetings, combine this node with a **Time Trigger** for automation.
* Use the `guestsCanInviteOthers` and `guestsCanModify` fields thoughtfully to control collaboration.
* Validate calendar permissions before using service accounts.
* Attach only lightweight files to events; use cloud links for larger resources.

## Example Workflow Integration

**Use Case:** Automatically schedule a meeting when a support ticket is received.

**Workflow Steps:**

1. **Email Trigger Node:** Detects new support requests.
2. **AI Node:** Summarizes the issue and proposes a meeting.
3. **Calendar Add Event Node:** Creates a Google Meet event automatically.
4. **Slack Message Node:** Notifies the support team with event details.

**Connection Example:**

```
{{emailTrigger.input.from}} → {{calendarAddEvent.input.guests}}
{{aiNode.output.content}} → {{calendarAddEvent.input.description}}
{{calendarAddEvent.output.eventLink}} → {{slackMessage.input.message}}
```

## Common Errors

* **"Invalid calendar ID"**
  **Cause:** The specified `calendarId` does not exist or access is restricted.
  **Solution:** Verify the connected account and calendar permissions.

* **"Invalid date format"**
  **Cause:** `startDate` or `endDate` is not in valid ISO format.
  **Solution:** Use proper ISO 8601 format, e.g., `"2025-10-27T09:00:00Z"`.

* **"End date earlier than start date"**
  **Cause:** The end time is set before the start time.
  **Solution:** Ensure the end date is later than the start date.

* **"Missing title"**
  **Cause:** The `title` field was left empty.
  **Solution:** Provide a valid event name.

* **"Meet link creation failed"**
  **Cause:** The account does not have permission to create Google Meet links.
  **Solution:** Enable Meet access in account settings or disable `addGoogleMeet`.
