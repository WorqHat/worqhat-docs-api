## Overview

The **Web Search Node** enables your workflow to search the internet in real time.
It retrieves up-to-date information, articles, summaries, and metadata from web sources based on a user-defined query.
This node is ideal for workflows that need live data — such as researching topics, finding references, or generating summaries from the latest information available online.

---

## Description

The **Web Search Node** connects your workflow to a web search engine using AI-assisted processing.
When given a search query, it automatically:

* Searches the web for the most relevant results.
* Extracts titles, URLs, publication dates, and short descriptions (snippets).
* Optionally provides a concise AI-generated summary of the top results.

This node helps automate research workflows, news monitoring, or any process that benefits from current web data — without leaving your automation environment.

---

## Input Parameters

The **Web Search Node** accepts the following input parameter:

* **searchQuery** *(string, required)*
  The main search term or question you want to query on the web.
  Example: `"latest breakthroughs in quantum computing"` or `"top AI startups 2025"`.
  This input determines what kind of content the node retrieves and analyzes.

---

## Output Parameters

After execution, the node returns structured web search data and metadata.

* **summary** *(string)*
  A short AI-generated summary of the most relevant search results.
  Useful for quickly understanding the overall context of the search.

* **results[]** *(array)*
  A list of individual search results retrieved from the web. Each result includes the following fields:

  * **results[].title** *(string)* — Title of the web page or article.
  * **results[].url** *(string)* — Direct link to the web page.
  * **results[].snippet** *(string)* — A short excerpt or description from the page content.
  * **results[].date** *(string)* — The original publication date of the content (if available).
  * **results[].last_updated** *(string)* — The last modified or indexed date of the page.

* **searchId** *(string)*
  A unique identifier assigned to each web search operation. Useful for logging or debugging multiple search runs.

---

## Output Type

* **Output Type:** Text (Structured JSON Result)

The node returns all data in structured JSON format, allowing downstream nodes (e.g., summarization or report-generation nodes) to easily access and process web content.

Example variable access syntax:

```
{{webSearch.output.summary}}
{{webSearch.output.results[0].title}}
{{webSearch.output.results[0].url}}
{{webSearch.output.searchId}}
```

## Example Usage

### Example 1: Basic Web Search

**Input:**

```json
{
  "searchQuery": "Top 10 programming languages 2025"
}
```

**Expected Output:**

```json
{
  "summary": "In 2025, Python, JavaScript, and Rust continue to dominate the developer community...",
  "results": [
    {
      "title": "Top Programming Languages in 2025",
      "url": "https://example.com/top-languages-2025",
      "snippet": "Python remains the most popular choice due to its versatility and AI ecosystem...",
      "date": "2025-09-10",
      "last_updated": "2025-10-20"
    }
  ],
  "searchId": "search-483912"
}
```

---

### Example 2: Research Query

**Input:**

```json
{
  "searchQuery": "impact of climate change on agriculture"
}
```

**Expected Output:**

```json
{
  "summary": "Recent studies show a significant effect of rising temperatures and droughts on crop yields...",
  "results": [
    {
      "title": "Climate Change and Global Agriculture",
      "url": "https://example.org/climate-agriculture",
      "snippet": "Research indicates that food security challenges are expected to rise...",
      "date": "2025-08-15",
      "last_updated": "2025-10-22"
    }
  ],
  "searchId": "search-948172"
}
```

## How to Use in a No-Code Workflow

1. **Add the Web Search Node**

   * From the **Utility** category, drag and drop the **Web Search** node into your workflow canvas.

2. **Set the Input**

   * In the input field, enter your search query or connect it dynamically from another node, e.g., `{{userInput.output.query}}`.

3. **Run the Workflow**

   * The node will perform a real-time web search and retrieve the latest information.

4. **Use Outputs in Other Nodes**

   * Connect the output to other nodes such as a **Text Generation** node for summarization or a **Database** node for logging search results.

5. **Access Dynamic Data**

   * Use syntax like `{{webSearch.output.summary}}` or `{{webSearch.output.results[0].url}}` in downstream steps.

---

## Best Practices

* Always provide a **clear and specific search query** to get the most accurate results.
* Avoid vague or overly long queries — concise phrasing yields better relevance.
* Combine this node with **AI Text Generation** to summarize or interpret web findings automatically.
* Use **Logger** or **Database Nodes** to store search results for later analysis.
* Be mindful of the **search frequency** to prevent exceeding API limits or redundant requests.

---

## Common Errors

* **"Missing searchQuery"**
  *Cause:* The search query input was empty.
  *Solution:* Ensure you provide a valid text input under `searchQuery`.

* **"No results found"**
  *Cause:* The query returned no relevant web pages.
  *Solution:* Rephrase or broaden your search query.

* **"Network request failed"**
  *Cause:* The node could not connect to the search service.
  *Solution:* Check your internet connection or retry later.

* **"Invalid response structure"**
  *Cause:* The search service returned an unexpected response.
  *Solution:* Contact support or retry with a simpler query.
