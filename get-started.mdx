## About WorqHat API

Welcome to WorqHat's Public API documentation.
This documentation was built to help you build your own custom integration with WorqHat's REST-based Application Programming Interface (API).

The official API server for WorqHat platform provides endpoints to manage workflows, retrieve metrics, and interact with the WorqHat ecosystem. With this API, you can:

- Execute database operations (query, insert, update, delete)
- Manage and analyze workflows
- Access system information and health status
- Manage users and their permissions

Some important notes to help you get started:

1. Access to WorqHat's API is currently Generally Available to everyone.
2. Review our [terms of service](https://worqhat.com/terms) before getting started with the development.

## Authentication

All API requests require authentication using API keys. Include your API key in the Authorization header using the format: `Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`.

To obtain an API key:

1. Log in to your [WorqHat Dashboard](https://worqhat.app)
2. Navigate to the API section
3. Generate a new API key
4. Store your API key securely
