title: 'Natural Language Query'
description: 'Query the database using natural language'
---

Executes database queries using natural language. This endpoint translates natural language questions into SQL and executes them against WorqDB.

```endpoint
POST https://api.worqhat.com/db/nl-query
```

## What Does This Endpoint Do?

This endpoint allows you to query your database using plain English questions instead of writing SQL. Think of it like having a conversation with your database - you ask questions in natural language, and the API translates them into SQL queries and returns the results.

## When to Use Natural Language Queries

- **For non-technical users** who need to query data but don't know SQL
- **For quick data exploration** without writing complex SQL queries
- **For building conversational interfaces** that need to translate user questions into database queries
- **For prototyping** when you want to quickly test ideas without writing formal queries

## How It Works

1. You provide a natural language question and specify which table to query
2. The API translates your question into a SQL query
3. The SQL query is executed against your database
4. The results are returned along with the generated SQL for transparency

## Request Body

<ParamField body="question" type="string" required>
  Natural language question to query the database (e.g., "How many active users do we have?")
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="table" type="string" required>
  The name of the table to query (e.g., "users")
</ParamField>

## Response

<ResponseField name="success" type="boolean">
  Indicates if the query was executed successfully
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="data" type="array">
  The query results as an array of objects
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="sql" type="string">
  The SQL query generated from the natural language question
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="executionTime" type="integer">
  Query execution time in milliseconds
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="message" type="string">
  A message indicating the status of the query execution
</ResponseField>

## Code Examples

## Request Body Explained

<ParamField body="question" type="string" required>
  The natural language question to ask about your data. Be as specific as possible for better results.
  
  Examples: "How many active users do we have?", "What was the total revenue last month?", "Which products had the highest sales?"
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="table" type="string" required>
  The name of the table to query. This helps the AI understand the context and structure of your data.
  
  Example: "users", "orders", "products"
</ParamField>

## Response Fields Explained

<ResponseField name="success" type="boolean">
  `true` if the query was executed successfully, `false` otherwise.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="data" type="array">
  An array of objects containing the query results. Each object represents a row in the result set.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="sql" type="string">
  The SQL query that was generated from your natural language question. This is useful for understanding how the AI interpreted your question.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="executionTime" type="integer">
  The time taken to execute the query in milliseconds.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="message" type="string">
  A message indicating the status of the query execution.
</ResponseField>

## Example Response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "count": 157
    }
  ],
  "sql": "SELECT COUNT(*) as count FROM users WHERE status = 'active'",
  "executionTime": 38,
  "message": "Query processed successfully"
}
```

## Common Errors and How to Fix Them

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| "Could not understand question" | Question is too vague or uses unknown terms | Rephrase with more specific language and common terms |
| "Table not found" | Incorrect table name provided | Verify the table name exists in your database |
| "Column not found" | Question references fields that don't exist | Use field names that match your database schema |
| "Query timed out" | Question generates an overly complex query | Simplify your question or break it into smaller parts |
| "Unauthorized" | Invalid or missing API key | Check that you're using a valid API key |

## Tips for Better Results

- **Be specific**: Include relevant details like time periods, categories, or conditions
- **Keep it simple**: Start with straightforward questions and gradually increase complexity
- **Use common terms**: Use terms that match your database schema when possible
- **Specify the table**: Always provide the correct table name to query
- **Review the generated SQL**: Check the returned SQL to understand how your question was interpreted

## Example Questions

Here are some examples of natural language questions you can ask:

- "How many users signed up last week?"
- "What's the average order value for premium customers?"
- "Show me the top 5 products by sales"
- "Count active users by country"
- "What was the total revenue in March 2025?"
