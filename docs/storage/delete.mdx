title: 'Delete File'
description: 'Permanently delete a file from storage'
---

Permanently deletes a file from storage using its unique ID. This action cannot be undone, so use with caution.

```endpoint
DELETE https://api.worqhat.com/storage/delete/{fileId}
```

## What Does This Endpoint Do?

This endpoint allows you to permanently remove a file from WorqHat storage. Think of it like deleting a file from your computer's trash - once deleted, the file cannot be recovered.

## When to Use Delete File

You'll find this endpoint useful when you need to:

- **Clean up old files**: Remove outdated or unnecessary files
- **Implement data retention policies**: Delete files that are beyond your retention period
- **Free up storage space**: Remove large files to make room for new ones
- **Handle user requests**: Delete user data upon request (e.g., for privacy compliance)
- **Remove temporary files**: Clean up files that were only needed temporarily
- **Manage storage costs**: Delete files to reduce storage usage and costs

## How It Works

1. You provide the **file ID** (obtained when you uploaded the file)
2. The API locates the file in your organization's storage
3. The API permanently deletes the file from storage
4. The API returns confirmation of the deletion

## Code Examples

## Request Parameters

<ParamField path="fileId" type="string" required>
  The unique identifier of the file to delete. This is the ID that was returned when you uploaded the file.

</ParamField>

## Response Fields Explained

<ResponseField name="success" type="boolean">
  `true` if the file was deleted successfully, `false` otherwise.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="message" type="string">
  A human-readable message describing the result of the deletion operation.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="deletedAt" type="string">
  The timestamp when the file was deleted (ISO 8601 format).
</ResponseField>

## Example Response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "File deleted successfully",

}
```

## Common Errors and How to Fix Them

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| "File not found" | The file ID doesn't exist or has already been deleted | Check that the file ID is correct and the file still exists |
| "Invalid file ID" | The file ID format is incorrect | Use a valid UUID format for the file ID |
| "Unauthorized" | Invalid or missing API key | Check that you're using a valid API key |
| "File access denied" | You don't have permission to delete this file | Ensure the file belongs to your organization |

## Tips for Safe File Deletion

- **Double-check file IDs** before deleting to avoid accidental deletions
- **Implement confirmation steps** in user interfaces before deletion
- **Keep backups** of important files before deletion
- **Use batch deletion carefully** to avoid deleting too many files at once
- **Log deletion activities** for audit purposes
- **Consider soft deletion** for files that might need to be recovered
- **Test deletion in development** before using in production
