At WorqHat, we are committed to respecting the privacy and confidentiality of our customer's data. Therefore, we will not use any data submitted by customers through our system or via our API to train or improve our models, unless the customers explicitly decide to share their data with us for this purpose. Customers can opt-in to share their data with us, but we only use such data for improving our models and to provide better service to our customers.

We also retain data sent through the system for a maximum of 30 days in your designated workspaces. This data is used solely for abuse and misuse monitoring purposes. After this period, the data is deleted, unless otherwise required by law.

Our data protection and privacy policy is in place to safeguard the confidentiality and privacy of our customer's data. We strictly adhere to all applicable data protection and privacy regulations, including GDPR and CCPA. We take all necessary technical and organizational measures to protect our customer's data from unauthorized access, modification, disclosure, or deletion.

Customers who decide to share their data with us can rest assured that their data is protected and used solely for the purpose for which they have given their consent. For more information on our data protection and privacy policy, please contact us.
