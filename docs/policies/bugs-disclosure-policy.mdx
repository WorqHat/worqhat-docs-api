title: 'Bugs Disclosure Policy'

*Welcome to WorqHat's Bugs and Security Disclosure Policy.* At WorqHat, we believe that security is a critical aspect of our mission to make AI and software accessible to everyone, regardless of their programming knowledge. To ensure the highest level of security and privacy for our users and technology, we value the contributions of hackers acting in good faith to help us identify and address vulnerabilities. Our policy is designed to provide a framework for responsible vulnerability research and disclosure. In this policy, we outline our definition of good faith in finding and reporting vulnerabilities and what you can expect from us in return.

## Rules of engagement
To encourage vulnerability research and to avoid any confusion between good-faith hacking and malicious attack, your testing must conform to all the following standards:

1. You are authorized to perform testing as long as you abide by the terms of all our policies.
2. Play by the rules. This includes following this policy, as well as any other relevant agreements. If there is any inconsistency between this policy and any other relevant terms.
3. Report any vulnerability you’ve discovered promptly.
4. Avoid violating the privacy of others, disrupting our systems, destroying data, and/or harming user experience.
5. Use only the support@worqhat.com email address to discuss vulnerability information with us.
6. Keep the details of any discovered vulnerabilities confidential until they are authorized for release by the WorqHat security team. WorqHat aims to provide said authorization within 90 days of receipt of each report.
7. Perform testing only on in-scope systems, and respect systems and activities which are out-of-scope.
8. Do not access, modify, destroy, save, transmit, alter, transfer, use, or view data belonging to anyone other than yourself. If a vulnerability provides access to such data, including but not limited to Personally Identifiable Information (PII), Personal Healthcare Information (PHI), credit card data, or proprietary information such as source code, model weights, or cryptographic/application secrets, please cease testing, delete local information, and submit a report immediately.
9. You should only interact with accounts and workspaces you own, unless otherwise authorized by WorqHat.
10. Disclosure of vulnerabilities to WorqHat must be unconditional. WorqHat does not offer compensation for vulnerability information. Do not engage in extortion, threats, or other tactics designed to elicit a response under duress. WorqHat will not allow Safe Harbor for vulnerability disclosure conducted under threat of full disclosure, exposure of data, or withholding of vulnerability information.
