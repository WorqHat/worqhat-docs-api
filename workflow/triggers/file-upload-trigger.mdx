## Overview

The **File Upload Trigger** node starts a workflow automatically when one or more files are uploaded.
It acts as the entry point for workflows that depend on user-submitted or system-uploaded files, enabling processes like file processing, document analysis, or image recognition to begin immediately after upload.

---

## Description

This node listens for file uploads and triggers the workflow when a file (or multiple files) is received.
The uploaded file can then be used as an input by downstream nodes for further processing such as text extraction, AI-based analysis, or storage operations.

It is particularly useful for workflows that involve:

* PDF or document uploads for analysis
* Image uploads for recognition or classification
* Audio or video uploads for transcription or processing

Once a file is uploaded, the workflow automatically starts and passes the file data to the next connected nodes.

---

## Input Parameters

The **File Upload Trigger** node accepts file uploads and optional metadata as input.

* **file** *(file, required)*
  The uploaded file that triggers the workflow.
  Supports documents, images, audio, and video formats depending on your workflow setup.
  This is a **mandatory parameter** — the workflow will not start without it.

* **Any custom metadata key** *(string, optional)*
  You can define additional key-value inputs for reference or tagging, such as:

  * `userId` → to identify the uploader
  * `category` → to classify the file
  * `description` → to describe the uploaded content

**Notes:**

* Only the `file` parameter is required.
* Extra parameters are optional and can be added for organizational or filtering purposes.
* All parameters are provided as simple key-value pairs (no nested objects).

---

**Instructions:**

* The `file` parameter is **mandatory** and must contain the uploaded file.
* You can add other input parameters as additional metadata.
* All extra parameters are simple key-value pairs and can be used in downstream nodes.
* The node does **not** process files directly — it simply triggers the workflow.

Access uploaded file data in downstream nodes using:

```
{{fileUploadTrigger.input.file}}
```

## Output Parameters

This node does not produce its own outputs.
Instead, it passes the uploaded file and input details directly to downstream nodes for use.

**Output Parameters:**
N/A

**Instructions:**
You can access the uploaded file or metadata in any connected node using variable references:

```
{{fileUploadTrigger.input.file}}       → File reference or ID
{{fileUploadTrigger.input.userId}}     → Custom metadata (if provided)
```

---

## Output Type

**Output Type:** N/A
This node serves only as a workflow trigger and does not generate a separate output type.

---

## Example Usage

### Example 1: Trigger on Document Upload

```json
{
  "file": "invoice_2025.pdf",
  "userId": "U001",
  "category": "billing"
}
```

**Expected Behavior:**
The workflow starts as soon as `invoice_2025.pdf` is uploaded.
Downstream nodes can access:

```
{{fileUploadTrigger.input.file}}       → "invoice_2025.pdf"
{{fileUploadTrigger.input.userId}}     → "U001"
{{fileUploadTrigger.input.category}}   → "billing"
```

---

### Example 2: Trigger on Image Upload

```json
{
  "file": "product_photo.jpg",
  "description": "Product listing image"
}
```

**Expected Behavior:**
The workflow is triggered automatically when `product_photo.jpg` is uploaded.
Subsequent nodes may use the file for image recognition, tagging, or analysis.

## How to Use in a No-Code Workflow

1. **Add the File Upload Trigger Node**
   Drag and drop the **File Upload Trigger** node into your workflow as the first node.

2. **Configure File Inputs**
   Define which file types or sources will trigger the workflow (e.g., PDFs, images, or audio).

3. **Add Optional Metadata**
   Include optional key-value inputs such as `userId`, `department`, or `description` if needed for tracking.

4. **Connect to Processing Nodes**
   Link this trigger to other nodes like **Text Extraction**, **Image Analysis**, or **Content Moderation** to process the uploaded files automatically.

5. **Test the Upload**
   Upload a test file to confirm the workflow triggers and downstream nodes receive the file data.

6. **Deploy or Activate the Workflow**
   Once verified, save and activate your workflow so it runs automatically upon future uploads.

---

## Best Practices

* Always ensure the `file` parameter is provided; workflows will not start without it.
* Keep filenames descriptive for easier tracking in logs or outputs.
* Validate file formats in downstream nodes if your workflow supports only specific types (e.g., PDFs or images).
* Add metadata parameters like `userId` or `source` to help identify uploads in larger workflows.
* Avoid attaching extremely large files to prevent delays or timeouts.
* Ensure you have proper access permissions for file handling nodes that follow.

---

## Example Workflow Integration

**Use Case:** Automatically analyze uploaded documents.

* Step 1: The **File Upload Trigger** node starts the workflow when a user uploads a PDF.
* Step 2: The **Text Extraction Node** extracts text from the uploaded file.
* Step 3: The **AI Node** summarizes the extracted text.
* Step 4: The **Email Node** sends the summary to the user.

**Workflow Connection Example:**

```
{{fileUploadTrigger.input.file}}   → {{textExtraction.input.attachments}}
{{textExtraction.output.content}}  → {{textGeneration.input.prompt}}
```

## Common Errors

* **"Missing file input"**
  **Cause:** No file was uploaded.
  **Solution:** Ensure a valid file is attached before triggering the workflow.

* **"Invalid file format"**
  **Cause:** The uploaded file type is not supported by downstream nodes.
  **Solution:** Confirm the file type is compatible with the workflow’s next node.

* **"Empty trigger"**
  **Cause:** The trigger received an empty payload or invalid upload.
  **Solution:** Retry the upload and verify that the file field is correctly mapped.

* **"Connection not established"**
  **Cause:** The trigger node isn’t connected to downstream nodes.
  **Solution:** Connect the trigger to at least one processing node.
