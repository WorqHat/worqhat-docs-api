**Category:** Logic and Flow Control
**Type:** Conditional Branching Node

---

## Overview

The **Switch Case Node** enables conditional logic within your workflow.
It evaluates an input value and directs the workflow to the appropriate branch based on the defined conditions.
If no condition matches, the workflow continues through the **Default** path, ensuring uninterrupted execution.

This node is ideal for creating workflows that require multiple decision points, such as routing data, performing different actions based on user input, or managing alternative outcomes.

---

## Description

The Switch Case Node functions like a decision gate. It checks an incoming value—such as a number, text, or boolean—and determines which branch of the workflow should be executed next.

For example:

* If the input is “1”, the workflow can proceed to an “Add Data” node.
* If the input is “2”, it can proceed to a “Delete Data” node.
* If the input does not match any case, it will follow the default branch and return a fallback response.

This ensures your automation logic remains organized and predictable.

---

## Input Parameters

The following inputs are used to configure the node:

* **Parameter** – The value to be checked (for example, `number: 2`).
* **Cases** – A list of possible values that determine workflow branching.
* **Default** – The fallback route if no cases match.
* **Parameter Type** – The type of input value (integer, string, boolean, etc.).

---

## Output Parameters

After evaluation, the node outputs information that defines which case was matched and where the workflow will continue next.

* **Parameter** – The value that was checked.
* **Parameter Type** – The type of data used in evaluation.
* **Matched Case** – The case name that matched the input value (or “default” if none matched).
* **Next Node** – The ID or name of the next node to be executed.

## Example Usage

### Example 1 — When a Case Matches

**Input:**

```json
{
  "input": {
    "number": "1"
  }
}
```

**Output:**

```json
{
  "parameter": 1,
  "parameterType": "integer",
  "matchedCase": "Add Data",
  "nextNode": "add-data-3"
}
```

In this example, the input `"1"` matched the “Add Data” case, so the workflow continued to that node.

---

### Example 2 — When No Case Matches

**Input:**

```json
{
  "input": {
    "number": "2"
  }
}
```

**Output:**

```json
{
  "parameter": "2",
  "parameterType": "integer",
  "matchedCase": "default",
  "nextNode": "return-state-5"
}
```

Here, the input `"2"` did not match any defined case, so the workflow followed the default path and returned the message:

```json
{ "enter valid choice": null }
```

---

## How to Use

1. **Add the Switch Case Node** to your workflow.
2. **Connect a Trigger Node**, such as the REST API Trigger, to pass input data.
3. **Select the Input Field** you want the node to evaluate (for example, `number`).
4. **Define Cases** that represent different workflow paths.
5. **Connect Each Case Output** to the appropriate node (for example, Add Data or Delete Data).
6. **Set Up a Default Path** to handle any unexpected or unmatched inputs.
7. **Test the Workflow** using sample inputs to ensure each case functions correctly.

---

## Best Practices

* Always include a **Default** branch to prevent workflow interruptions.
* Ensure the **data type** of your input matches the defined case values (for example, `"2"` as a string vs `2` as an integer).
* Use clear, descriptive names for each case to simplify debugging.
* Test each case individually to confirm correct routing before deploying your workflow.

---

## Example Workflow Integration

A common implementation looks like this:

```
REST API Trigger → Switch Case → (Add Data / Delete Data / Return State)
```

In this setup:

* Input `"1"` routes to the **Add Data** node.
* Input `"2"` routes to the **Delete Data** node.
* Any other input follows the **Default** path to the **Return State** node, returning a message such as `{ "enter valid choice": null }`.

---

## Common Errors

* **Issue:** Every input goes to the default branch.
  **Solution:** Verify that your input matches the defined case values and data types.

* **Issue:** Workflow stops unexpectedly.
  **Solution:** Ensure a Default branch is configured and connected.

* **Issue:** Incorrect node triggered.
  **Solution:** Double-check that each case is properly linked to the intended next node.
