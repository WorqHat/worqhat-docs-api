## Overview

The **Send Mail Node** allows you to send emails directly from your workflow.
It’s commonly used for sending notifications, confirmations, reports, or automated messages — all without writing any email or server code.

---

## Description

This node helps you send an email through a configured sender identity. You can define who the email is from, who receives it, the subject, the message content, and optionally include attachments.
When the email is sent, the node returns details such as whether it was successfully delivered, how long it took, and a unique delivery ID you can use for tracking or logs.

---

## Input Parameters

Here’s what you need to provide when configuring the node:

* **senderEmail:**
  The email address used to send the message. This must be a verified or authorized sender email. *(Required)*

* **senderName:**
  A display name that appears as the sender. For example, “Harshada”. *(Optional)*

* **recipientAddress:**
  The email address of the recipient. You can also enter multiple addresses separated by commas or as a list. *(Required)*

* **cc:**
  Optional email addresses to send a carbon copy to. Can be a single address or multiple ones separated by commas. *(Optional)*

* **bcc:**
  Optional blind carbon copy addresses that stay hidden from other recipients. *(Optional)*

* **subject:**
  The subject line of your email. *(Required)*

* **body:**
  The main message of your email. You can write plain text or HTML, such as `<p>Hello</p>`. *(Required)*

* **attachments:**
  Any files you want to send with the email. These can be file objects or URLs, depending on the platform. *(Optional)*

---

## Output Parameters

When the node runs, it returns the following:

* **deliveryStatus:**
  Tells you if the email was sent successfully or failed (for example, “sent”, “failed”, or “queued”).

* **deliveryTime:**
  Shows how long it took to send the email, usually in milliseconds.

* **deliveryId:**
  A unique identifier for the email delivery. You can use this for logging or debugging.

---

## Output Type

The output is a **JSON object** containing delivery information, such as the status, time, and a unique ID. You can use this output for confirmation messages, conditional logic, or audit records in your workflow.

## How to Use in a No-Code Workflow

1. Add the **Send Mail Node** to your workflow.
2. Open its settings panel.
3. Choose or enter your **sender email** (must be a verified sender).
4. Add your **sender name** if you want it to show up in the “From” field.
5. Enter the **recipient’s email address**.
6. Add **CC** or **BCC** addresses if needed.
7. Type your **subject line**.
8. Write your **email body**. You can use plain text or HTML.
9. If you want to attach files, add them under **Attachments**.
10. Save your changes and connect this node to your previous nodes.
11. When the workflow runs, this node will send the email automatically and return the delivery details.

## Best Practices

* Always use a verified sender email to prevent messages from landing in spam.
* Keep subject lines short and relevant.
* Use simple HTML for formatting (avoid heavy styles or scripts).
* Test your email content by sending to yourself before final deployment.
* Avoid sending large attachments; use file links instead.
* Store or log the `deliveryId` and `deliveryStatus` for troubleshooting or record keeping.
* Add retry logic if an email fails to send.

---

## Example Workflow Integration

Here are a few ways this node fits into workflows:

* **Form Submission → Send Mail → Return Status:**
  Send a confirmation email after someone submits a form.

* **Report Generation → Send Mail:**
  Generate a document or summary report and email it to a user.

* **Scheduled Trigger → Send Mail:**
  Automatically send reminders or summaries at set intervals.

---

## Common Errors

* **Email not sent (deliveryStatus: failed):**
  The recipient’s email address may be invalid or the sender is not authorized.

* **Sender not verified:**
  The email used as sender must be verified with the platform.

* **Attachment not found:**
  Ensure that any attachment file or URL is valid and accessible.

* **Spam filtering issues:**
  Avoid spammy words or large images. Use verified domains with SPF/DKIM setup.

## Configure Sender Email Address

1. **WorqHat's domain**
- You will be using the subdomain for sending emails.
- Assign a name, for example "xyz," as the Sender Name.
- The Sender email will be xyz@notifs.worqhat.com.

2. **Your own Domain**
- To verify ownership of a domain, you must have access to its DNS settings to add the necessary records.
- Select your region.
- Enter your Sender Name, with examples such as:
  - john@company.com
  - john@mail.company.com
  - john@subdomain.company.org

3. **Email address**
- To verify ownership of an email address, you must have access to its inbox to open the verification email.
- Configure the email address by adding and verifying it as a sender.
- Enter your email address and a verification link will be sent to your inbox.
- After submitting your email, you will see this message: **"We need to verify your email address before you can send emails from it. Please check your inbox for the verification link. The link will expire in 24 hours."**
- Once you verify your email by clicking the link, you can start sending emails.
